            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>My very Good Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MY laſt came to tell your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> I had a great Ambition to be related unto ſo much Worth and Goodneſs; this to declare unto the world how happy that Relation makes me; and what my Obligations are unto your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> to whoſe Inſtructions and Example, Diſcourſe and Counſil (next to the Divine
<pb facs="tcp:105209:3"/>Benediction,) I owe thoſe ſmall Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, which I have hitherto attain'd: and from whoſe Favours and Protection, I derive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts &amp; the Satisfactions of my Life, and the Encouragements of all my Labours.</p>
            <p>But had I no ſuch motives to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, yet Equity &amp; Prudence would oblige me to lay this Eſſay at your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> feet, Whoſe Works ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inform us, You are as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully convincing, and happily ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful, in your divine Attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Great <hi>Leviathans,</hi> and proud <hi>Goliahs,</hi> who have <hi>defy'd the Armies of the living God,</hi> as in thoſe Matters which alone admit of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Demonſtration. Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:105209:3"/>hath ſecured that Scripture to us, on which our Hopes and Happineſs depend, and all our Arguments do bottome; and rendred Infidelity as baſe and ſcandalous, as it is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Soul, by adding this unto the Sinfulneſs and Danger of it, that it muſt be now embraced and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in, againſt the higheſt Reaſon &amp; moſt clear Conviction to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>And now my <hi>Lord,</hi> what can the man do that cometh after You? even that which hath been done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. He therefore beſt conſults his Credit in this cauſe, who writes after your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> Copy, as being not ſo vain to imagine that he can do better; he fights ſecurely who

            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Diſſolute ungodly Life being as well the cauſe as the reſult of Atheiſm, we cannot wonder that it ſhould improve ſo fast, or think it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to prevent its Growth, in ſuch an Age of Wickedneſs, as this in which we live; wherein men dayly offer ſuch Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts to Heaven, that it concerns them there ſhould be no God to puniſh them, and live ſo great a contradiction to Chriſtianity, that it becomes their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to prove it falſe; and then their Intereſt perverts their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and they are eaſily perſwaded to believe, what they are ſo concerned to wiſh, and they find ſo needfull to
<pb facs="tcp:105209:6"/>procure an undiſturbed progreſs in the ways of Sin, and to quiet all the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of a Guilty Conſcience. And ſince theſe <hi>Sons of Belial</hi> do ſo induſtriouſly promote the Devils Kingdome, ſince they have wholly given up themſelves to vile Affections, and freely do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge to all the Pleaſures of a ſinfull appetite, it is no wonder that <hi>their Eyes are blinded by the Prince of darkneſs,</hi> and that they are <hi>led captive by him at his will.</hi> It is but juſt that <hi>God ſhould ſend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them ſtrong Deluſions, that they all may be damned who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not the Truth, but have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed the Generality of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts are ſuch raw, ſhallow, trifling
<pb facs="tcp:105209:6"/>things, and ſo unable to judge of ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Matters, that we cannot reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly impute their Infidelity, to any thing they can object againſt Chriſtianity, and therefore muſt aſcribe it to thoſe impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and headſtrong Luſts, which bear the greateſt Oppoſition to it.</p>
            <p>And yet had they but leaſure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, did not their Luſts both buſy and pervert, that little Reaſon they have left, they might perceive it was not want of Motives, or of ſufficient Reaſon to believe, which did betray them to their Infidelity, but want of Wiſdome to conſider of the Motives ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; and that to live the Atheiſt is to act in contradiction to the avowed Principles of Humane Nature, and the known Rules of Reaſon.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:105209:7"/>
            <p>For <hi>1.</hi> Who knows not that <hi>in matters of the higheſt Moment, that way muſt be the beſt, which is the ſafeſt?</hi> Since then Chriſtianity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords the higheſt Comforts in Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and gives the nobleſt Pleaſures, and the moſt powerfull Inducements to be juſt and upright, kind and helpfull to our brother: ſuppoſe it were <hi>a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly deviſed Fable,</hi> what could we ſuffer by the practiſe of it in a Chriſtian Commonwealth? Whereas, ſhould it prove true, our Infidelity muſt rob us of the higheſt Bleſſings, and everlaſtingly ſubject us to the worſt of Miſeries.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> 
               <q>Such a Perſwaſion as will make men circumſpect, and earneſt to avoid a leſſer danger, ought with more reaſon to prevail upon them to decline a greater;
<pb facs="tcp:105209:7"/>Such a perſwaſion as will ſharpen mens Deſires after, and quicken their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors for the obtaining of a leſſer Good, ought with more reaſon to engage them with an equal vigor in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of a greater, yea an infinite good. For ſince the apprehenſion of Good or Evil, is the ſole motive to make us undertake or decline any Action, the greater that Good or Evil is, the ſtronger motive it muſt be.</q> Now do not many Millions in the world foregoe their preſent Eaſe and Pleaſure, encounter Difficulties, adventure upon Dangers, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe moſt toilſome Labours, in hopes and expectations of ſome finite temporal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, of which they cannot have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? Do they not oft abſtain from what they paſſionately love, only for fear
<pb facs="tcp:105209:8"/>of danger, which poſſibly might not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue upon the Satisfaction of their Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite? Do they not Sow and Plant and trade only in hopes of an encreaſe? and ſhould not then the hopes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities of infinite eternal Happineſs provided for the pious Chriſtian, engage us to obey Gods Precepts, and to reſist all thoſe Temptations which fleſh and blood ſuggeſts againſt them? If thus to ſeek the <hi>falſe uncertain Mammon</hi> be the great Wiſdome of the world, can it be Folly to purſue with equal diligence and vigour, but with better Hopes, the true &amp; laſting Riches? If then it be but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that all the world throughout all Ages, did not embrace the Doctrine of a Providence, without ſome plauſible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement ſo to do; If all the primitive
<pb facs="tcp:105209:8"/>Martyrs and Confeſſors did not ſuffer for the Name of Christ, and all ſucceeding Generations did not embrace or continue in the Profeſſion of the Faith of Chriſt, without all reaſon, motive, or even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable inducement; If any of thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities we have amaſs'd together in the cloſe of this Diſcourſe deſerve to be eſteemed ſuch, or any of thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which in this Treatiſe we have urged, be probable, then muſt the Folly of the Atheist be exceeding great, and clear beyond exception.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> 
               <q>It muſt be Folly to renounce that Faith, which hath been Generally own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by men of ſtrongeſt Parts, and moſt diſcerning Judgments, in very many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and through many Generations, and which delivers matters of ſo great
<pb facs="tcp:105209:9"/>Moment and Concern, that our eternal Happineſs or Miſery depends upon them, till we have uſed the Greateſt diligence to ſearch into the Reaſons, which induced them to believe it true.</q> Let then the Atheiſt ſay, what he hath done to ſatisfie his judgment in this great Concern; whether he ever did peruſe the writings and Apologies of Antient Fathers, or the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Divines, who have diſcourſed upon this Subject, to the Satisfaction of the knowing World? Whether he ever did conſult with Perſons of the beſt abilities, propound his ſcruples, and conſider of the Anſwers given, before he ventured to ſcoff at, and renounce his Faith? If not, this is ſufficient to convince him of the greatest Folly in the World.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:105209:9"/>
            <p>If any that pretends to have uſed all this diligence, and all theſe Endeavours, continue ſtill to queſtion and ſuſpect the truth of Chriſtian Faith, and of the Doctrine of a Providence, let me intreat him to conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Whether thoſe motives which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to renounce a Providence, or Chriſtian Faith, will not compel him to renounce thoſe things of which he hath the evidence of Senſe and Reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him? if ſo, we have as great aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the falſhood of thoſe motives as Sence and Reaſon can afford.</p>
            <p>If then you do reject a Providence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are not able to conceive Gods Omnipreſence, or any other Attribute on which this Providence depends; if you renounce the Myſteries of Chriſtian
<pb facs="tcp:105209:10"/>Faith becauſe you cannot apprehend them; have you not equal reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Notions of Infinite unbounded ſpace, of an Eternal Flux of Time, or an Indiviſible Eternity, which yet your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt acknowledge? Muſt you not queſtion the Exiſtence of the Souls of Men and Brutes, as being not ſufficient to conceive, that Spirits, if confined to points, can performe any of thoſe actions which we aſcribe to them, or that they can diffuſe themſelves through Bodies, receive impreſſions from them, or make impreſſions on them: or that meer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould perceive, reflect and reaſon, or have any ſenſe of pain and pleaſure? Laſtly must not this Principle oblige you to Question the Existence of all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Compounds? For who is able to
<pb facs="tcp:105209:10"/>conceive that Indiviſibles can be united? or that a Grain of Sand can be for ever diviſible, and have as many parts as the whole World?</p>
            <p>If you do queſtion or diſpute the truth of any Miracle, Revelation, or Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, becauſe you are not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the manner how it was or may be done, this will oblige you to denie the Ebb and Flowing of the Sea, till you are able to acquaint us with the true Cauſes of it, and to diſtruſt that ever you were born, becauſe you never can explain the manner of your own production. <hi>For as thou knoweſt not the way of the wind, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with Child, even ſo thou knoweſt not the works of God who maketh all things.</hi> Eccl. <hi>11.5.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:105209:11"/>
            <p>If you are tempted to diſown theſe Revelations, becauſe you are not able to conceive Gods Ends and Reaſons in them, Why he who hath proclaimed Himſelf the God of Mercy ſhould threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten an eternal puniſhment to finite tranſitory Sins; why he ſhould leave the World ſo long in Darkneſs, and the like. Might not a Subject on the like account reject the precepts of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign becauſe not able to perceive the Wiſdome of them, or the neceſſity of all the Sanctions he annexeth to them? Is it not certain that if there be a God, he muſt be infinite in his perfections, and ſo incomprehenſible, and then his Wiſdome muſt exceedingly tranſcend the reach of finite Apprehenſions? the Secrets of it muſt be double to that which doth appear
<pb facs="tcp:105209:11"/>to us, and there muſt be ſuch depths both in his Judgments and his Acts of Mercy as we can never fathome. So that unleſs the Notion of an Infinite and all-wiſe Being includes a contradiction in the Terms, we cannot doubt but that he may reveal what we can never apprehend. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides we cannot underſtand the Beauty or Wiſdome of Divine Tranſactions, but we muſt be acquainted with the Ends and Motives, the Tendence, and reſult of all he doth: for otherwiſe what ſeems abſurd to us, may admirably comply with the Deſignes of Providence, what ſeems con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in the Beginning may conclude in Order and the Greatest Beauty. Since then we do not know the minde of God, ſince we are not acquainted with the Deſignes and Purpoſe, nor are we able to
<pb facs="tcp:105209:12"/>look forward to the Reſults of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it is ſure we cannot paſs a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Wiſdome of them.</p>
            <p>If you are tempted to diſown the Chriſtian Faith, becauſe you are not able to reconcile it to your ſhallow reaſon, and infirm Conceptions; This will oblige you to denie the Being, Propagation, the Swiftneſs, or Continuation of all Motion, it being certain we are not able to give an Anſwer to all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments produced againſt the different degrees of Swiftneſs, or the Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the very Being of it, or to conceive how Motion can be propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It is acknowledged that an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, plain, indiſputable Contradiction, cannot be matter of our Faith, or of a Revelation from the God of truth. But
<pb facs="tcp:105209:12"/>ſeeing it is alſo evident that all matters infinitely great, (as infinite Duration, Power, Space,) and infinitely little, (as the indiviſible parts of Space &amp; Time,) do as much bafle and confound our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings as do the Attributes of God, and do abound with difficulties as ſtubborn and unweildy as any Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Goſpel do afford, it muſt be raſhneſs to reject theſe Revelations as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Dictates and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of that Reaſon which is obliged to own ſuch Notions as do abound with equal, if not greater Difficulties. And certainly if Mathematicks will afford its Demonſtrations <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> if Matters obvious to ſenſe do oft confound the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding; it is not to be hoped it ſhould wade thorough the Abyſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb facs="tcp:105209:13"/>perfections, and not be overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and loſt.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Conſider whether you have not greater reaſon to believe theſe Doctrines then to disbelieve them. From what is here diſcourſed in the introduction, it is clear we have as many reaſons to aſſert a Providence, as we have reaſons to believe that any ſignal Demonſtrations of Gods power have been made by any acts of Judgment or of Mercy, in any Parts or Ages of the World, or that his Wiſdome was engaged in any Revelations, Oracles, Predictions, Dreams or Viſions ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, or in the Production of the World, and in the exquiſite Contrivance of any Portion of it. We have as many reaſons to believe a Providence as we have to aſſert that any good or evill Angels do
<pb facs="tcp:105209:13"/>exist; or ever did appear, or interest themſelves in any actions of Mankind. And yet our reaſons which evince the truth of Chriſtian Faith, are far more numerous and cogent. Let then the Atheiſt view and ponder what we have here produced in confirmation of theſe Truths, and then conſider whether his motives to renounce Chriſtianity, and to reject a Providence, be more numerous and more convincing, then what this Treatiſe offers to eſtabliſh them. If not, he muſt have greater Reaſon to aſſert, then to diſown them; and ſo his Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie muſt be the worſt of Follies.</p>
            <p>Laſtly Conſider whether he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the Chriſtian Faith muſt not be forced to believe whats more incredible then any Myſtery contained in it. For
<pb facs="tcp:105209:14"/>he muſt believe, that Christ and his Diſciples, and the Chriſtians of the three first Ages did endeavour to confirm the world in the belief of what they knew to be a lie; and conſequently that all the Primitive Profeſſors, who did ſo court the Flames, and were ſo wearie of this preſent life, were yet the vileſt Atheiſts, as not believing there was any God to puniſh this their pernicious lye. Or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly that they were all beſide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they had loſt the principles of preſervation and Self Love, which Nature hath ſo deeply planted in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Brutes, and that they made it their deſigne to ruine and deſtroy their Souls and Bodys, their Friends and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, to abandon all the Pleaſures of this Life, and to expoſe themſelves to
<pb facs="tcp:105209:14"/>all the Miſeries that can be incident to humane Nature, without any motive but the love of Miſerie.</p>
            <p>And yet he muſt believe that they who did ſo little understand the common Principles of humane Nature, were able to enrich the World with the beſt Notions of a Deity, and of a future State, and the beſt precepts of Moralitie that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature ever was acquainted with. And that theſe Fools had wit enough to propagate their Doctrine, and to obtain belief throughout the World, maugre all oppoſition that all the powers of men and Devils could make againſt them. Or <hi>2ly</hi> he muſt believe theſe Atheiſts choſe to quit their Lives, and ſuffer all the miſeries they underwent, only to beat down Atheiſme, and to eſtabliſh
<pb facs="tcp:105209:15"/>that Religion which bears the Greateſt Oppoſition to all the Naturall reſults of Atheiſme. He muſt believe that what is written in the Books of Scripture, and the Apologies of all the Chriſtians, and that all that they pretended and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to in every corner of the World, were but prodigious impudent untruths: and that the World was univerſally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Worſhip a condemned Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor as <hi>God Bleſſed for evermore,</hi> and to embrace the Doctrine of the Croſs with all its Diſadvantages, without a ſeeming Miracle. Or <hi>2ly</hi> he muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they had no aſſiſtance in the Propagation of the Faith beſides thoſe arts of Magick, in which both Jew and Gentile were more expert then they, and which Apoſtates who were very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
<pb facs="tcp:105209:15"/>and frequent, learned and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, were equally acquainted with; and yet that never any of them did attempt to imitate, or to diſcloſe their Art: or that the world, when thus convinced of the Deluſion, would notwithſtanding univerſally embrace and chuſe to ſuffer for what they knew to be confirmed only by thoſe Magical Colluſions, which they ſaw daily practiſed by Jew and Heathen; and in which they were inſtructed by thoſe very Chriſtians who did ſo ſignally condemn thoſe Arts as Deviliſh, and threaten everlaſting Miſery to all that uſed them. He must believe that all the Records of any ſignal Judgement, which ever did befall the Enemies and Blaſphemers of the Chriſtian Faith, or any portion of it, or of
<pb facs="tcp:105209:16"/>any Mercies, Preſervations, Gifts or Aſſiſtances vouchſafed to them in any age or places of the Chriſtian World are void of Truth in every particular. He must believe an hundred matters of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which this Treatiſe will ſuggeſt: And therefore <hi>Reader,</hi> I intreat you to peruſe it with that care and diligence which matters of this moment do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and then I hope it may be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to convince you of, and confirm you in the Truth of Chriſtian Faith, which is the hearty deſire of</p>

                  <p>WHAT Endeavours have been made to ſtop the Growth of Atheiſme and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, by aſſerting an all wiſe preſiding Power viſible in the production of the World. What ſeemeth further neceſſary to be alledged againſt the Atheiſt. An eſſay towards the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of a Providence. <hi>(1)</hi> From the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of evil ſpirits. <hi>(2)</hi> From many ſignall demonſtrations of Gods power; <hi>(3)</hi> of his Judgments upon Rebellious ſinners; and <hi>(4)</hi> of his power and Mercy in preſervation of his ſervants, and his miraculous Anſwers to their prayers. <hi>(5)</hi> From revelations and predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things contingent in their various cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. <hi>(6)</hi> From apparitions of good and evil Angels. <hi>(7)</hi> From dreams and viſions ſupernatural. <hi>(8)</hi> From things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by pretenders to miracles, Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Witches, Oracles, philoſophers, which could not be effected naturally, &amp;c. The
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105209:22"/>confirmation of the Chriſtian faith by what hath been delivered; <hi>(1)</hi> by evincing that Providence hath been engaged for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of ſome particular Religion in the world; <hi>(2)</hi> that that particular Religion is no other then the Chriſtian faith.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. VVHAT Artifices have been uſed of late to baffle all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; to undermine the pillars and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it: how bold and impudent the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Satan are, how free to vent, &amp; how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious to infuſe their poyſon into every ſoul; &amp; how unhappily diſpoſed the greater part of Mankind is, by reaſon of the vile Affections, and brutiſh Luſts, which reign in them, to ſuck in this helliſh Vomit, tis needleſs to informe the Reader. He muſt have ſhut his Eyes who doth not ſee, and ſtopt his Ears who doth not hear, the ſad, but juſt complaints, of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Atheiſm and Irreligion in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world.</p>
               <p>§. 2. TO ſtop the Growth of this pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Evil, ſome have endeavour'd to aſſert the Being of a God, not from the Metaphyſical foundations which the Scholes have laid, but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105209:22"/>from the Phaenomena of Nature, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them a greater Evidence of ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding Wiſdome &amp; over-ruling Power: which being undeniably concluded from what they have diſcourſed on this Subject, it remains only to evince, that this preſiding Wiſdome in the Creation of the World had a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar eye unto the Welfare of Mankind, and doth at preſent watch over that noble part of his Creation, gives indications of his Will &amp; Pleaſure, as far as is conducing to our Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and Motives to obey that Will: ſince <hi>he that cometh unto God muſt believe that he is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.</note> and <hi>that he is a rewarder of thoſe that diligently ſeek him.</hi> For if we ſuppoſe that from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world there were eſtabliſhed ſuch Laws of Action, as doe neceſſitate the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and productions which ſhew the Wiſdome of their Great Contriver, (though we ſhould alſo doubt whether he ever did, or doth at preſent intereſt himſelf in the concernments of Men, and the free motions of their Wills; and ſhould conceave with modern Theiſts, wee are too inconſiderable to be the matter of his care and Providence,) we ſhould ſufficiently comply with the intent and vigor of thoſe Arguments.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not venture to ſupply what's lacking to thoſe late attempts, by any large diſcourſe on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105209:23"/>the myſterious Theme of Providence, which others have improved beyond what I am able to perform, but only hint ſuch things which in conjunction ſeem to make it highly rational to own the thing: and which I do not find ſo fully, nor I think ſo convincingly, propoſed in other Writers on this Subject.</p>
               <p>§. 3. AND 1. If there be any evil Spirits which maligne the Welfare of Mankind, then there muſt be a Providence. For were there no ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Power that did curb and over awe them, and by ſo doing ſhew his care of Man, they would according to their inclinations, either inflict upon Mankind at preſent the ſoreſt and moſt dreadful Evils which could be incident to humane Nature (this being the deſign and drift of hatred to plague and to confound its object;) or if Mens ſouls be ſubject unto future Miſeries, more Great and laſting then any they can ſuffer in this preſent life, it would be the endeavour of theſe Spirits, to reduce the world to ſuch compliance with their humors, and full ſubmiſſion to their wills, as would aſſuredly ſubject them to thoſe future Miſeries, or ruine thoſe who ſhould refuſe obedience to them. Now the Exiſtence of theſe evil Spirits may be concluded from their Operations. For if the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105209:23"/>Heathen Oracles did e're foretell what it was not in the power of man to ſee, (of which their Authors give us very many inſtances:) If any ſeeming miracles were ever wrought for the eſtabliſhment of Heatheniſm, or any other way of Worſhip not allowed by God, (which even Chriſtians do confeſs,<note place="margin">vid. Chap. <hi>9.</hi> ſect. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> and Scripture doth acknowledg:) If any perſons ever were poſſeſſed by the devil; If they have ever ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken languages they underſtood not, told things of which he only could informe them; or have receav'd aſſiſtance or temptations from him to deſtroy themſelves: if ever he appear'd to any of his Proſelytes in the dark corners of the World; or the aſſemblies of thoſe perſons that are devoted to his ſervice; we muſt then own his Being in the World, and his deſign to ruine us at preſent, or to enſlave us to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in order to our future Ruine. Now only to tranſcribe the Hiſtories and Records of theſe things would be the work of many vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, they being atteſted by many Myriads of all Ages, and of all Countries of the World, confeſſed by thoſe who have engaged in the Worſhip of the Devil, confirmed by the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of both the Indies, ſuppoſed by the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by the Goſpel Story, the <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, <hi rend="sup">2</hi> Chriſtian, and the <hi rend="sup">3</hi> Heathen Exorciſts;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105209:24"/>theſe Spirits being ſubject, not only to the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but to the invocation of the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of <hi>Jſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Jacob,</hi> though uſed by thoſe who did not <hi rend="sup">4</hi> own their faith, but notwithſtanding did atteſt upon their own experience the virtue of thoſe names, as well as <hi rend="sup">5</hi> Jews and Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>§. 4. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> IF there have ever been any diſplays or actings of Gods power, if any Miracles vouchſafed in confirmation of the faith of Jew, or Chriſtian, Turk, or Heathen; all which have more or leſs pretended to them;<note place="margin">

                  </note> did any of thoſe miracles w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>. in their writings are recorded of them, &amp; of which we give a large account in our Diſcourſe upon that Subject: I ſay, if any of theſe things were done, we muſt acknowledge ſome ſuperior Power did
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105209:24"/>engage in the aſſiſtance of thoſe perſons, and was concerned to have the world believe what they delivered. By which aſſiſtance, if the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Power did intend the Happineſs and Welfare of Mankind, he makes proviſions for it, and by ſo doing ſhews a Providence; but if he deſigne mans Ruine and Deſtruction, he muſt then be an evil and ſeducing power, which ſure could not be, were there no higher Power to challenge and reward our Service, and to revenge our Diſobedience.</p>
               <p>§. 5. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. IF any ſignal Judgments were infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the immediate hand of God upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious ſinners (of which the Annals of all ages and books made up of ſuch collections yeeld us large accounts:) If any viſible declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods wrath, and of approaching Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, have been made unto the world by Signes &amp; Prodigies, by Dreams and Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by Propheſies, or by a voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, (of which not only Hiſtories Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and heathen do inform us, but ſuſpected <hi rend="sup">7</hi> Atheiſts do confeſs and prove the ſame:) If there hath ever been a deluge over the world, (which, ſince the Caverns of the earth containe the waters of it, can never be effected by the courſe of nature;) or <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah</hi>

And having made good the Doctrine of an All-ruling Providence, it will be eaſie to advance unto the Confirmation of the Chriſtian Faith, by theſe Gradations.</p>
               <p>§. 11. 1. THAT this Providence hath been engaged for the Eſtabliſhment of ſome particular Revelation and Religion in the World; and hath as ſignally oppoſed ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which have pretended to thoſe Names, and conſequently doth not eſteem them all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.

               <p>§. 12. AND ſecondly, That no particular Revelation, to which the adverſe Parties have pretended, can ſtand in Competition with the Chriſtian Faith, or give in equal Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of its Truth, and Derivation from a Deity,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105209:35"/>it being certain, that of theſe Inſtances pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to evince a Providence, none are ſo powerfully convincing as thoſe that do aſſert the Chriſtian Faith; the Experience of Gods Mercies, Protections, and Aſſiſtances vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to the Profeſſors of it, as alſo of his Judgements on their Adverſaries, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of his Power in Confirmation of this Doctrine, being more numerous and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and more unqueſtionably true. Adde to this, That ſeeing <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets (by their evident Predictions of a <hi>Meſſiah</hi> that ſhould come attended with thoſe very Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and ſhould perform and undergoe all that Chriſt did and ſuffered? do confirm the truth of Chriſtian Faith, it will follow that theſe Inſtances fore-mentioned, which do aſcertain the Veracity of thoſe Prophets, and Gods Concernment for the Laws delivered by them, muſt alſo give in full Conviction to the Truth of our <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and his Doctrine.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, It is evident that all theſe Forms of Worſhip, which ſtand in Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it, are either moſt apparently repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant both to the Wiſdom, Purity, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Deity, or ſuch as carry with them no Conviction of their Truth and Goodneſs, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which ſpeaks them worthy of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of the God of Heaven. For that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105209:35"/>thoſe Modes of Worſhip which had obtained in the Heathen World, were vile and filthy, ridiculous and brutiſh, and moſt repugnant to thoſe Conceptions of a Deity which Nature hath implanted in us, will be ſo evident from what we ſhall diſcover of them, that <hi>he who runs may read it.</hi> As for <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi> that having no internal Evidence which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of its Truth, no Purity and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in its Precepts, and no Subſervience unto the Welfare of Mankind at preſent, or to his Happineſs hereafter, beyond what Scripture doth afford us, but Promiſes and Precepts more Carnal and Judaical, and Stories more extravagant and idle, then the wildeſt Fables;<note place="margin">

                  <p>THAT common Prudence would not ſuffer the Apoſtles to pretend ſuch things in their hiſtorical Relations of the life of Chriſt, and in their Epiſtles to the Churches newly converted, as muſt infallibly diſgrace their Teſtimony, and make them appear Guilty of Deluſion. <hi>(2)</hi> That the Miracles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in thoſe Hiſtorical Narrations and Epiſtles, if true, are a convincing Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that ſome Superiour Power did aſſiſt the Workers of them. <hi>(3)</hi> That Chriſt and his Diſciples had no Aſſiſtance from Good or evil Angels to impoſe upon the World.</p>

But we ſee not only by their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but by the Writings of the Heathens, that they ſped in their Deſign; that Chriſtian Religion was ſo propagated in that Age, whil'ſt ſome of Chriſts Diſciples were yet living; and therefore we may reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they were not, and could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105209:52"/>of Falſhood; but that what they had ſaid and written of theſe Matters was unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably true.</p>
               <p>Proleg. 2. <hi>The miraculous Operations of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, if done according to the Records left concerning them; muſt be a ſignal Evidence of ſome inviſible ſuperior Power enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to aſſiſt them.</hi> For 1. They chiefly were employed in the ejection of the Devil, who is a Spirit, and therefore inviſible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be ejected but by a Power which is Inviſible. And ſecondly, They were done by means which could have no proportion to the greatneſs of the Work, no real Influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Object, and ſo could be no Cauſes of the Effect produced. For inſtance, that theſe Words,<note place="margin">

That Faith in Jeſus ſhould immediately enable Men to ſpeak thoſe Languages they were never taught; that Bread, by being broken, ſhould be multiplyed above an hundred fold; that the curſing of a Fig-tree ſhould make it wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that at the Crucifying of a ſuppoſed Malefactor, there ſhould be ſuch a concurrence of Prodigies; the Sun to gather darkneſs, and the Earth to tremble; the Rocks to rend, and Dead to riſe: It is not to be imagined that theſe things ſhould ſo happen, without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of ſome Heavenly Power. Thirdly, Some of theſe Operations were for matter ſuch as Juglers never did, or could pretend to with any ſhew of Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> Speaking with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Tongues to others, and giving this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto thouſands, only by Impoſition of the Apoſtles hands.

               <p>Proleg. 3. <hi>Chriſt and his diſciples had no aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, whether from Good or evil Angels, to delude the world.</hi> Good Angels are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of heaven, and ſtrict obſervers of the pleaſure of a good and holy God, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, what they endeavour to promote, muſt be agreable to the will of God; their actions and deſigns muſt be conſiſtent with their natures and appellations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as muſt deſigne the good and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of thoſe Perſons whom they endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to confirm in this belief; which ſince it viſibly did tend unto their preſent ruine, muſt give aſſurance of that future Bliſs, which it did promiſe as the reward of what they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105209:54"/>who embraced it; and ſo aſſure us that God was well pleaſed with, and ſtood en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to reward their ſufferings. Nor is it reaſonable to imagine, that divine power ſhould be ſo ſignally employed, to beguile and betray the world into ſo Groſs Idolatry, as is the worſhip of a vile Impoſtor for the God of heaven; or that this power ſhould be at ſuch expence of Miracles, to lift an Impudent blaſphemer into the uſurpation of his own prerogative. Or laſtly, that his Goodneſs ſhould permit him, to be ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtrumental, to engage whole Myriads of well meaning Perſons in the profeſſion of a lye, ſo viſibly deſtructive to their preſent welfare; eſpecially conſidering that the ſame miniſtery of Angels, or ſome more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate engagement of divinity, might as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually have reduced the world into obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to the unerring dictates, whither of reaſon, or of Revelation.

For the effecting of which ends, he could uſe nothing better, than that Groſs and palpable

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105209:55"/>can be more contrary to his deſign, then thoſe things which are brought in by the Chriſtian Religion, which cautions us ſo oft, and ſo ſeverely, againſt thoſe wiles and Methods, which had ſo long ſeduced and captivated the Heathen World unto his pleaſure; whith tends wholly to promote true Love, and to knit men together in the bonds of Charity; to inſtill thoſe laws of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Virtue that contribute ſo much unto the Welfare of mankind; which preſs us with ſo much zeal to imitate divine Perfections, become the faireſt tranſcripts of a Deity, and ſo the Greateſt Sticklers againſt Satan and his Kingdome.

And as their Multitude encreaſed, ſo ſtill they were the more likely to diſcloſe it: their Diſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both through Deſign and Perſecution, carryed them throughout all the World; and being ſo divided in Place, it was hard for them not to contradict one another, it was impoſſible for them to conſpire in ſo great a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105209:70"/>Juggle; their Enemies were every day more awakened to oppoſe them, more vigilant to ſearch and pry into their Arts, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to quell the growing Faction; their Miracles more frequently repeated, and before greater Multitudes; and laſtly, were continued through divers Ages: all which may aſſure us that they were no Deceivers.

                  <p>§. 8. SHOULD it be here objected, that the aſſurance which we have, that the Apoſtles did pretend ſuch things on which our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do bottom, depends upon the truth of Sc. Story, of which no evidence is Given.</p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:105209:72"/>
                  <p>I Anſwer; That our Arguments depend partly upon ſuch poſtulata as carry with them a convincing evidence, and partly, on the ſuppoſition of ſuch actions done, of which we have the beſt aſſurance that matters of that nature can afford. Our poſtulata are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſt profeſſed to be the King, or Meſſiah of the Jews, and conſequently both to do, and ſuffer what was expected from, and propheſied of their Meſſiah; and had it not been ſo what expectations could he have of being ſo eſteemed? or what could tempt the writers of his life and actions to be ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the mention of things to which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did pretend? what could induce the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Profeſſors to inſiſt ſo much upon thoſe Arguments? what motives could he have to ſuffer or pretend ſuch things as were expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from Shilo?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Diſciples of this Jeſus were what Jew and Gentile ſtill objected to them, and they themſelves confeſs'd, poor ignorant deſpiſed Perſons. Thirdly, That theſe Diſciples could not be taught to carry on their Maſters deſign, if it were a Deluſion, but they muſt know their Maſter to be a vile Impoſtor, and muſt deſpair of all that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and that Aſſiſtance which he promiſed; and that the like muſt be aſſerted of all thoſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105209:73"/>who did endeavor to promote the Chriſtian Faith, by Arts received from them. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That things being thus ſuppoſed, they could not but know, that all which He and his Diſciples did pretend, was groſs Hypocriſie. Fifthly, That Perſons having all the Reaſons to renounce Chriſt, which both their preſent and eternal Intereſt, their love of Truth and of their Countries ſafety, Credit and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could ſuggeſt unto them, but not one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to avouch his Doctrine, would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo to do; much leſs could they prevail upon the World to imitate that Phrenſie which was ſo greatly oppoſite to all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Ingenuity and Reaſon, Truth and Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, That we have juſt aſſurance that the Primitive Profeſſors of Chriſtianity did pretend theſe things, will be evinced from theſe Conſiderations. For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, 'Tis evident from their Apologies and Writings in the firſt Ages of the Church, that throughout all the World the Chriſtians did for divers Centuries appeal to the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our Lord and his Apoſtles, and to the Gifts and powerful Operations of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, they daily exerciſed, and to the ſpeedy Propagation of the Goſpel through the then known World, as to the moſt convincing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105209:73"/>Evidences of the Truth of Chriſtian Faith; which conſident Appeal aſſures us, That thoſe things were matters of unqueſtionable Truth. And 2ly, It is likewiſe evident, they held that riches were<note n="a" place="margin">

Our Saviour could not be deceived, if his pretenſions to be the Saviour of the World, and to accompliſh what was foretold of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> were not falſe: and if they were, this muſt infallibly deſtroy his Credit waith his Friends, (ſuppoſing what we have already
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105209:76"/>proved, that they were not wilfully Deceivers) and give his Enemies too, juſt occaſion to cry out on the Impoſtor. The Teſtimony of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>John</hi> concerning him; the voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; the Holy Ghoſts deſcent in likeneſs of a Dove; Gods Declaration to him by theſe Tokens, that he was <hi>the Lamb of God,</hi> muſt be Deluſions too: What <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and his Virgin Mother did pretend to ſee and hear; what <hi>Simeon, Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, muſt be the iſſue of diſtempered Brains; however, they were Men and Women of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable Lives,</hi> and <hi>Reputations.</hi> Both they who taſted of the Water, which he preſumed was turned into Wine, and thoſe Five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Perſons which were fed with five Loaves, and with two little Fiſhes, muſt have their Eyes, and Appetites, and Palates all deceived; Chriſt having, as it is here ſuppoſed, no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to put a Cheat upon them: All Chriſts Predictions muſt be falſe, and all the Spirit of Propheſie, to which the Primitive Chriſtian did ſo much pretend, muſt be the Illuſion of the Fanſie: Imagination muſt produce that Star which led the Wiſe Men to our Saviour, and form thoſe Voices which both he and his Diſciples, and the whole Multitude did ſeem to hear; It muſt produce thoſe frequent Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions of Angels, and that Transfiguration
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105209:76"/>which his Apoſtles ſeemed to ſee. It muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the winds, and make the Sea obey him, and muſt enable him to walk upon it; It muſt form a conceit in him that he was the Son of God, and Saviour of the world; one ſent into it from his Fathers boſome to take upon him fleſh, and ſuffer for the ſins of men; and all theſe great and ſtrong deluſions, muſt conſiſt with an exemplary life, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wiſdome, ſo viſible both in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and diſcourſes, as he that runs may read it; and laſtly, with a Glorious reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and the abundant Graces of is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Again, it muſt prevaile upon himſelf and his Diſciples, and the whole body of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers (diſperſed through the then known world) not only to believe that they did dayly caſt out Divels, cure diſeaſes, raiſe the dead, that they did propheſy and ſpeak with tongues, but alſo on the eyes and eares of his and their Spectators, and their Hearers, and make them flock with their diſeaſed to the places where they were, and preſs to touch their Garments, and come within the compaſs of their ſhadow, or beg they would but ſpeak the word that ſo their dead might live, and their diſeaſed might be whole. Imagination muſt prevaile on thoſe who were before poſſeſſed, to believe,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105209:77"/>that afterwards they were not, and ſo upon the very devil to lie dormant in them, it muſt prevail on thoſe that were ſick of what diſeaſe ſoever, to conceive that they were well; and think their ſores and iſſues did not run; upon the Lame to think they walked, upon the Deaf to think they hear'd, upon the dead to think themſelves alive, and laſtly, upon thoſe with whom they did converſe (that is on their profeſſed enemies throughout the world, me learned and inquiſitive, and moſt concerned to find out the truth) not only to believe the ſame, but own the Chriſtian faith upon the ſtrength of thoſe deluſions. In a word this phanſie muſt give eyes unto the Blind, and feet unto the Lame, and eares unto the Deaf, and life unto the Dead, through divers cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies together, or it muſt have deluded the whole world with thoſe pretentions for divers Generations, no man intending in the leaſt to put a cheat upon them. Or laſtly, it muſt prevail upon mankind to credit and to venture both their preſent and future, even their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal welfare, to confirme what both their eyes and eares and other ſenſes told them, was but the vain deluſions of ſome brain-ſick Perſons; and what is now recorded thus, that <hi>Many when they ſew the miracles that Jeſus did, believed;</hi> ſhould be written thus, that <hi>many
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105209:77"/>when they ſaw the Great Deluſions Chriſt and his Diſciples ſuffer'd, believed on him.</hi> Now to conceive ſo ſtrong and ſpreading a deluſion ſhould ſeaze upon ſo many millions through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all climates of the world, and this alone in the firſt ages of the Church, never before or after; that it ſhould be peculiar to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> never ſhould agree to the <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> or the <hi>Heathen,</hi> is a phanſy ſo prodigious, that nothing can be more. If we can once imagine, that the eyes and eares, and apprehenſions of ſo many millions, ſhould throughout diverſe centuries, be ſo continually, and univerſally deceived, what reaſon have we to believe either our ſenſes, or our undeſtanding, or to expect that others ſhould do ſo? Why do we not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſuſpect the like in all we ſeem to ſee, or hear, or underſtand? and ſo ſet up for <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> and ſeekers in all things whatſoever. In a word it was never heard ſince the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, that men of a deluded phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy did pretend to matters of ſo high a nature, and yet deliver precepts of ſo confeſs'd an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, that no Philoſophy could match, no Laws or Rules of Living, how ever fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by long experience, hard ſtudy, and the greateſt ſtrength of humane reaſon, could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare therewith. And hence it is, that never any of their malicious Adverſaries, however
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105209:78"/>they pretended things as frivolous and as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd as this, did ever charge them with ſuch Groſs deluſions, or once imagine, that they could prevail upon ſuch feeble Grounds; and therefore it would be folly to proceed to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of what no <hi>Atheiſt, Heathen, Turk,</hi> or <hi>Jew,</hi> did ere object againſt them.</p>

                  <hi>that we may ſafely take an eſtimate of Christian doctrine, from what we find recorded of it in the books of Holy Writ.</hi> For it is incongruous to conceive, that Records which pretended to derive from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangelists,</hi> (whilſt both they, and many of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts lived, and did receive the Goſpel from their mouthes,) and which exhorted all with
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105209:79"/>ſo much paſſion to retain, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Faith delivered to the Saints,</hi> and which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſuch dreadful curſes and Anathemas upon thoſe who preached another doctrine; and charg'd them to ſhun the man who did not own their platforme, and not <hi>bid him God ſpeed:</hi> I ſay it is incredible, that records of this nature ſhould undermine that Faith, which thoſe Apoſtles had ſo largely planted, and ſhould preſent the Churches they converted, with ſuch a ſtanding contradiction to that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they had ſo lately taught, and yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and be received as the ſacred Oracles and only Records of the Chriſtian faith; ſtill more incredible it is, that ſuch a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be indited by thoſe very men, and yet they paſs for the Embaſſadors of the King of Heaven, and the prince of Peace.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. It is moſt apparent, that the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſucceeding Age could not be ignorant of what was thus delivered to the Church, (whilſt the Autographa were extant, as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> tells us in his time they were) when the Canonical books were evidently propoſed as ſuch, and (if we may believe the ſuffrage of Antiquity) collected and avouched by St <hi>John;</hi> yea whileſt thoſe very perſons were alive to whom thoſe writings were directed, and with whom they were entruſted, yea by
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105209:79"/>whom they were tranſcribed, and <hi rend="sup">3</hi> read in publick and in private.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly, This corruption of the word of God, or ſubſtitution of any other doctrine for it, could not be done by any part or Sect of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but they who had imbraced the Faith, and uſed the ſame Copies of the word of God in other places of the Chriſtian world, muſt have found out the cheat; and therefore this corruption, if at all effected, muſt be the work of the whole world of Chriſtians. But can it be ſuppoſed that the immediate ſucceeding ages ſhould univerſally conſpire to ſubſtitute their own inventions for the word of God, and yet continue ſtedfaſt in, and ſuffer ſo much for that Faith, which denounced the ſevereſt judgments againſt them that ſhould doe ſuch things? or that a world of men ſhould with the hazard of their lives and fortunes, and all that was dear to them in this preſent world, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch the Goſpel, and at the ſame time make ſo great a change even in the frame and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of its doctrine, &amp; become guilty of ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal an Apoſtacy from what the Goſpel had delivered, whilſt it yet ſounded in their eares, employ'd their tongues, and was the Matter of the worlds Great Conteſt, and by ſo doing make it ineffectual? Can it be thought that they ſhould venture upon that, which, were the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105209:80"/>Goſpel true or falſe, muſt needs expoſe them to the Greateſt evills, whilſt they continued Abettors of it? But had this bin done, can we in reaſon think that of thoſe many thouſands who in the Primitive Ages did renounce the Goſpel, that of thoſe many 3 wavering Spirits, thoſe excommunicate Members, eſpecially thoſe 4 Hereticks, who upon other motives did renounce the Greateſt part of Scripture: I ſay, can it be thought, that none of thoſe ſhould publiſh and diſcloſe the forgery, or anſwer the Allegations made from Scriptures, that they were all ſuppoſititious; but that ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent forgeries ſhould find a general reception from all that ſearched into their Truth, and be unqueſtionably received as genuine both by Jew, and Gentile, Chriſtian, and Pagan, ever in thoſe times in which, and in thoſe places where they firſt were uttered, and by thoſe Perſons who ſo lately received another do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine?</p>
               <p n="4">4ly, Suppoſe thoſe Primitive Profeſſors could have been Guilty of ſo vile a thing. Can we believe that God who ſent his Son out of his boſome to declare this Doctrine, and by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit to indite and Preach it, and by the witneſs of ſo many and great miracles confirme it to the world; ſhould ſuffer any wicked Perſons to corrupt and alter
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:105209:80"/>any of thoſe termes on which the happineſs and welfare of mankind depended? Much more to ſuppreſs and ſmother them, as that a counterfeit repugnant Story ſhould obtain in lieu thereof; and ſo the benefit of all that Chriſt had done, and his Apoſtles delivered to the world, ſhould be entirely loſt? That Chriſt ſhould do or ſuffer ſo great things in order to the welfare of mankind, and yet permit thoſe Sons of Belial to fruſtrate all that he had done, and rob the world of all the vertue of his death and ſufferings, can be conceived rational, by none but ſuch as think it not abſurd to ſay, that That God who ſent his Son to die for our Salvation, and that Jeſus, who became ſo great a ſufferer in order to the ſame deſigne, ſhould jointly envie and maligne the Good of Man. Nay ſince thoſe very Scriptures which have been received for the word of God, and uſed by the Church as ſuch from the firſt ages of it, pretend to be the termes of our Salvation,<note place="margin">

               <p>Laſtly, Thoſe Records being once ſo <hi rend="sup">6</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally deſperſ'd through places at the greateſt diſtance, ſo univerſally acknowledged and conſented to by Men of curious Parts, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Perſwaſions, and repugnant Judgements, and great Averſions from each other, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their Originals unto ſucceeding Ages, and <hi rend="sup">7</hi> multiplyed into divers Verſions, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Chriſtians <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the Records of his Hopes and Fears; and thereupon being ſo <hi rend="sup">8</hi> carefully ſought after, ſo riveted in their minds (for many Fathers had them all <hi rend="sup">9</hi> 
                  <hi>memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter,</hi>) ſo frequent in their Writings; ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly <hi rend="sup">10</hi> rehearſed in their Aſſemblies, by Men whoſe work it was to Read and Preach, and to exhort to the performance of thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they enjoyned: being ſo often cited in the Confeſſions, Comments, Apologies, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles of the Chriſtian Worthies; as alſo in the Objections of thoſe Adverſaries to whoſe view they ſtill lay open: it muſt needs be true, that they were handed down to the ſucceeding Generations, pure and uncorrupt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſuch upon whoſe Credit we may
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105209:81"/>venture to paſs an Eſtimate of Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>§. 2. AND if it be objected, That we find by the Citations of the Ancients, that there was a difference betwixt their Copies of the Scripture, and theſe now extant among us; it is anſwered from ocular Demonſtration, whoſoever ſhall compare the ancient Copies, or any Texts that were cited by the Primitive Chriſtians, with thoſe Scriptures which we now own and uſe, ſhall find no conſiderable variation. We ſee that Engliſh Bible which we read and uſe in every Pariſh and Family, though it be often falſely Printed, yet receives no variation which is not ſoon and eaſily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected: and why ſhould we ſuſpect the ſame of the Original Scriptures, and of thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which were tranſcribed and read tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout the Chriſtian World. If then no Writing, whileſt the Apoſtles lived, could paſs for Chriſtian Faith, and yet deſtroy and undermine it, and be receiv'd as their Epiſtles when it was nothing leſs: If their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Succeſſors could not be ignorant of what the Apoſtles committed to them, to be read and Preached as the Records of their Faith and Doctrine, nor would they be induced to deliver that for ſuch, which they believed not
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105209:82"/>to be ſo, (they being Men whoſe Holy Lives, as well as Sufferings, made a full proof of their exact Integrity.) If neither they could uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally conſpire to effect this thing; nor can it be ſuſpected that Providence ſhould ſuffer them to do a thing ſo contrary to its great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of love unto Mankind: If laſtly, it is morally impoſſible, that ſince the ſecond Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury thoſe Writings ſhould be either forged, or accidentally corrupted in matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and moment, they muſt remain ſufficient Records of the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> Hence it follows, That thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings muſt be the very Works of thoſe <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> whoſe Names they bear; ſince no Man could pretend they were ſo, had they not really been ſuch, but they muſt put a cheat upon the World, and ſubſtitute their own Inventions for the Word of God. Indeed, they have been handed down for ſuch by a more general Tradition, and of a firmer Credit then any of thoſe Books of <hi>Virgil, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> or <hi>Martial,</hi> which we indiſputably own as theirs. For it was a Tradition of the whole <hi rend="sup">12</hi> Chriſtian World, which owned, and cited, and received them for ſuch from the Apoſtles days; as is apparent from the Epiſtles of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Clement, Barnabas, Ignatius, Polycarp,</hi> the Works of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> whil'ſt others, which pretended to the ſame Original,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105209:82"/>were univerſally rejected by them. Beſides, they did atteſt them ſo to be by many Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (which they had no Temptation to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, beſides the truth of their Aſſertion;) and many Wonders to confirm their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. It was a Tradition which concern'd things of the higheſt moment, and which it was their greateſt Intereſt to be well aſſured of, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſole ground and matter of their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port at preſent under the ſharpeſt Tryals, and of their future hopes, and therefore Writings they were concern'd to get, and hear, and read, and keep; Books written to whole Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Nations, yea the whole <hi rend="sup">13</hi> World of Chriſtians, who could not have received them eaſily, had the Apoſtles, by whom they were at firſt converted, given no Intimations of them: Books of the greateſt oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Superſtition both of Jews and of Gentiles, and which denounced againſt them the greateſt Plagues and Judgments; ſuch as obliged them to ſearch, as much as it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, into the Truth of what they ſaid: And yet theſe Books were not denyed to be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Works of thoſe <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> whoſe Names they bare: Books which no cheat could be concern'd to forge, nor could obtain that belief which was not due to them, without the greateſt Forgery: Books which could not be ſpread abroad as they were in the

Laſtly, They being written partly to confirm and to aſcertain to us the ſtory of Chriſts Birth, Life, Paſſion, Reſurrection, and partly to engage us to believe; partly to put an end to Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and rectifie thoſe Errors which had crept into the Church in the Apoſtles days, and which did need a ſpeedy Reformation; partly to juſtifie themſelves againſt falſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and to aſſert the Truth of their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip; and partly to preſerve their Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes from ſuch as did pervert the Faith; and partly to inſtruct them how to bear up in Fiery Tryals, and to ſupport the Soul under thoſe Miſeries the Chriſtians ſuffered; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on thoſe Grounds which did require their quick diſpatch on that Errand, and to thoſe Churches unto which they did intend them, it
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105209:83"/>is evident the Apoſtles muſt intend that early notice ſhould be given of them, and ſo accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly commit them to their new-born Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes and Babes in Chriſt: and ſo the Records of our Saviour his Life, Death, Reſurrection, Miracles, muſt be divulged throughout <hi>Iudea,</hi> whil'ſt the far greater part of Men were able to diſprove them if they had been falſe.</p>

                  <p>THE Truth of Chriſtian Faith aſſerted from the Gifts and Operations of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt in general: and more particularly from the Gift of Propheſie, and from the Gift of Tongues.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. HAVING by what is thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed prepar'd the way, we now advance to that moſt clear and cogent evidence of Chriſtian Faith, which the Apoſtle ſtiles <hi>the demonſtration of the Spirit, and of Power;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">I <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4.</note> and we have ample confirmation of it, both from the <hi>Gifts,</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> the <hi>Predictions</hi> and <hi>Powerful Operations of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Chriſtian Doctrine, and its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervience unto our preſent and eternal Welfare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. NOW that the Gifts and Power of the Holy Ghoſt were thus engaged to confirm and propagate this Faith, will be apparent,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105209:88"/>1. From that aſſurance which the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> give both to the<note n="a" place="margin">

                     <hi>Acts</hi> 4.31, 33.</note> when it ſo roundly tells us, <hi>They were all filled with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Thirdly, This is apparent alſo from their confident ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal unto the Teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt, as a convincing Demonſtration of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our Lord.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 5.30, 31, 32.</note> 
                  <hi>The God of our Fathers hath raiſed Ieſus to be a Prince and Saviour, and to give repentance unto Iſrael, and we are his witneſſes of theſe things, and ſo is that holy Ghoſt, which he hath given to them that obey him.</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:105209:88"/>They ſpake of this Teſtimony as a convincing motive to the Prophet, or Spiritual Perſon, to acknowledge, that what <hi>the Apoſtles writ,</hi>

                  <hi>was the commandment of God;</hi> and that the Goſpel which they Preached was the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Truth, and that which was to be retained in oppoſition to the Law:<note place="margin">

For had they not been aſſured of the truth of Chriſtian doctrine, tis both impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they ſhould, and inconceavable they would have ſuffer'd after ſuch a manner.

               <p>§. 1. A Further evidence of the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, vouchſafed to the primitive Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, is their deportment under ſufferings, their unwearied Patience, and unſhaken Faith, their undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courage under the Greateſt preſſures, and more amazing Kindneſs to their bloudy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors. Which will appear more viſible, if we conſider. (1) How <hi rend="sup">1</hi> great and exquiſite the torments which they ſuffer'd were. For it was the buſineſs of their Perſecutors, both to invent the keeneſt and moſt confounding Torments, and to <hi rend="sup">2</hi> take care the Chriſtians might ſtill live to ſuffer them; that if their ſharpneſs could not, their continuance by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees might weaken and ſubdue their Faith. And 2ly. If we conſider the number of their adverſaries.<note place="margin">Quoties ſuo jure nes inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eum vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit lapidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendio.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105209:92"/>and Condition of the Perſons ſuffering; they being of all Ages, <hi rend="sup">6</hi> Places, and <hi rend="sup">7</hi> Conditions; the ſoft and yeelding Sex, whoſe weakneſs and infirmities could not have born much leſſer ſufferings, without ſome Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly power to aſſiſt them; the wiſeſt <hi rend="sup">8</hi> ſages, who could not eaſily be fool'd into their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, or periſh without Good aſſurance it was their intereſt ſo to doe: and on the other hand, the greateſt Idiots, who are moſt ſubject to be frighted by the rod, and over-awed by terrors into baſe complyance, as having not ſufficient reaſon to defend their tenets, or to oppoſe againſt the ſenſe of preſent miſery; they being alſo Men of religious Education, lives unblamable, which bore the greateſt <hi rend="sup">9</hi> Kindneſs, did the beſt Offices,<note place="margin">Occidunt eos quos &amp; ipſi fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentur i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatores eſſe juſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Lact. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>9.</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>the World was more exhauſted by one Perſecution then by the moſt bloudy Wars.</hi> And 6ly. the effect of thoſe ſo bloudy Perſecutions, <hi>viz,</hi> The <hi rend="sup">11</hi> encreaſe of Proſelytes, the more
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105209:93"/>effectuall Propagation of the Chriſtian Faith; the ſhame and the <hi rend="sup">12</hi> Conviction of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; Conviction ſo great, that on this very ſcore they oft deſiſted from their intended executions. And to conclude, the manner of their Sufferings doth give us full aſſurance, that the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, which Chriſt and his Apoſtles promiſed to true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, was accordingly vouchſafed to thoſe Martyrs. They having born the Greateſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, not only with undaunted Courage, but with <hi rend="sup">13</hi> Joy and Exultation; and being as deſirous to ſuffer for the name of Jeſus, as their Perſecutors were to Torment them; and finding oftentimes <hi rend="sup">14</hi> a perfect freedome from all Senſe of Paine under the moſt afflicting preſſures; Miraculous <hi rend="sup">15</hi> Experience of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations under Sufferings; of <hi rend="sup">16</hi> deliverance from them, and of an over-ruling, <hi rend="sup">17</hi> controul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſometimes <hi rend="sup">18</hi> vindictive power upon the inſtruments of their Sufferings. Now,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) It ſeems impoſſible they could thus ſuffer without Divine aſſiſtance. For (1) what could create a freedome from the ſenſe of Pain under the Greateſt Torments, and moſt intolerable burthens unto fleſh and blood? What could inject ſo great a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror into the fierceſt of wild beaſts, as to muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle their mouthes, and ſtop their craving appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites?
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:105209:93"/>and what could cauſe inſenſate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which by the Laws of Nature act to the utmoſt of their ſtrength, to looſe their wonted Efficacies? What ſhould create ſuch Joys and Exultations, ſuggeſt ſuch comforts and ſupports under the ſharpeſt and moſt fiery Tryalls and continuall preſſures, the very thoughts of which afflictions have ſlain their hundreds, and made them out of dread of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Fury become their own Tormentors? What could embolden thoſe who tremble at the Rod, and are ſo ſcared by the threats and frowns of angry Parents; Thoſe who cry out, and Skreek, and Swoon at the approach of leſſer Evills, yea dread thoſe Terrours which their own Phanſies did create; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the worſt of Torments when they were placed before their eyes? to bear up with more then humane Courage againſt inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Cruelties; to endure them without a Sigh or Groan, and by their patience to baffle and Torment their Perſecutors? That which doth cool the courage of the ſtouteſt hearts, how ſhould ſo many Feeble Souls encounter? And that at which the beſt of men do ſhrink and tremble, which they do pray and ſtrive againſt, how could they who were held to be the filth and the ofscouring of the world, deſpiſe and laugh at?</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:105209:94"/>
               <p>§. 3. BUT 2ly. Tis more improbable they would undergo thoſe fiery Trials without a full aſſurance of the Greateſt bleſſings and rewards hereafter. We ſee how few will quit their Pleaſures and Enjoyments here (though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſpeaks ſo loud, and their duty is ſo oft inculcated) to purchaſe all the Glories of another world. Life is ſo ſweet, that moſt men do deſire to preſerve it, though upon moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable and unworthy terms. And would then ſuch a world of men in ſo many Nations, and throughout ſo many Centuries of yeares, without all hopes of future bleſſings (but what deluded phanſie could ſuggeſt) doe what's ſo highly inconſiſtent with the firſt principle of humane Nature, the reaſon &amp; experience of all paſt ages, and of all that were then to come? In a word if they were Good men, to be ſure they would not ruine and deſtroy themſelves; if bad men, it muſt be their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to live, and to enjoy the pleaſures of this preſent world; the future being either the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their dread, or at leaſt no matter of their hopes. Nor can it reaſonably be conceaved that Providence, which hath ſo Great and tender a regard to the ſincere and honeſt heart, ſhould let ſo many thouſands of well meaning Souls, periſh by the deluſions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded hopes, and vain imaginations,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105209:94"/>and not dart in one ray of light to guide them to the truth.</p>
               <p>§. 4. <hi>Object.</hi> SHOULD any here object the 19 <hi>Spartan</hi> boyes, who would not ſhrink at the ſevereſt whippings; the <hi rend="sup">21</hi>

                  <hi>Anaxarchus, Regulus,</hi> or a <hi>Zeno;</hi> the <hi>Quakers, Anabaptiſts,</hi> or ſuch like hardy ſects: It may be ſufficient Anſwer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind them of the rareneſs of their ſufferings, or the condition of the Perſons ſuffering; in all which circumſtances they are not to be compared with Chriſtian Martyrs. At leaſt not any of them will be found to have ſhewn ſuch Charity towards them that were the cauſes of their Sufferings, experimented ſuch Joys and conſolations under ſufferings, ſuch perfect freedome from all ſenſe of pain, ſuch ſignal inſtances of an all ruling and ſometimes Vindictive Power upon the inſtruments thereof, as was vouchſafed to thoſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</p>
               <p>Adde to this, that Philoſophers ſtood bound in honour, (the thing they moſtly thirſted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) thus to doe and ſuffer. Their Philoſophy was but the doctrine of contempt of Death. It was their dayly buiſineſs to commend it
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:105209:95"/>to their Scholars; and hence ſo many of them did either<note n="a" place="margin">Menippus. Laert. lib. <hi>6.</hi> Ed.

Whereas the meaner ſort of Chriſtians could have but little ſenſe of Honor; their profeſſion did forbid them to deſire, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and would be ſure to expoſe them to the greateſt infamy.</p>
               <p>Agen, the <hi>Spartan</hi> boy was taught by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and Inſtructions, Experience and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, to endure his Stripes; and frequent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation made the wiſe man valiant; the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian void of all thoſe helps became a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and undaunted ſufferer; and oftentimes the Chriſtian and the Martyr did begin to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> and the <hi>Quaker,</hi> beſides the lightneſs of their ſufferings, they bottom upon expectation of an exceeding weight of Glory: whereas the Chriſtian muſt ſuffer all thoſe Miſeries (as our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſuppoſeth) only to propagate a known deluſion. For we have fully proved by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legomenon the 5th. that he could not be ſo far deluded as to believe himſelf in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:105209:95"/>if they had been falſe. And this <hi rend="sup">24</hi> conſideration gives the Greateſt ſtrength unto this preſent Argument, it being never known that any Sect of men conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſcarce any ſingle perſon, continued for one year, much leſs through divers Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, to ſuffer the ſevereſt Torments to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate a known deluſion.</p>

                  <p>§. 1. TO ſtrengthen what we offer from the predictions of our Lord in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Chriſtian Faith, it will be needfull to premiſe, That the punctuall ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of predictions of things future and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, eſpecially when thoſe predictions deſcend to many Circumſtances, and thoſe ſuch as are peculiar and unuſuall, and ſuch as reſpect the unconſtrain'd motions of the will: I ſay, this fulfilling of predictions, gives juſt aſſurance to us, that an all Wiſe and over-rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Providence doth intereſt it ſelfe in their completion. For 1. He only who at firſt made all things by his Power, and by his Wiſedome guides them to their reſpective ends, He whoſe will &amp; pleaſure doth give laws to all the motions of the Soul, and limits to the powers of Inferior cauſes, he only can foreſee the iſſues, and foretell thoſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which do entirely depend upon ſuch cauſes. Yea 2ly. that mind, which through its own inherent power, is able to determine any matters of this nature, muſt on the ſame grounds be acquainted with all future things, though never ſo contingent in their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate cauſes; there being equall reaſon for them all.

                  <p>§. 3. LOE here a crowd of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſo certainly foretold of the Meſſiah, as that the Jew found nothing to except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: ſo ſignally fulfilled in our Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, that nothing can be farther needfull to confirme their truth. And 3dly. incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to any other perſon. For that I may not here repeat what I have already ſay'd, that no man would have choſen to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe thoſe hard termes, which were declared in the Scripture of the Old Teſtament, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Meſſiah; it being contrary to humane Nature to deſire to lead a poor and miſerable life, and then dye a painful Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious death, unleſs it were in proſpect of ſome great advantages that might accrue unto him; ſuch as the reſurrection, and thoſe other glorious things that were foretold of the Meſſiah. But now could any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hope for ſuch a glorious reſurrection,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:105209:106"/>and to enable a few illiterate deſpiſed perſons, by mighty ſignes and wonders by admirable Gifts and Graces of the Holy ſpirit, to ſubdue the world to the beliefe of things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible? viz. To owne and worſhip for the God of Heaven and Earth, one who was lately hanged on a tree, and one that by his owne Nation was rejected as the worſt of Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours.</p>
                  <p>§. 4. AND now to take off that objection which is ſo often made by <hi rend="sup">18</hi> 
                     <hi>Celſus,</hi> and other Adverſaries of the Chriſtian Faith, <hi>that all thoſe places of the old Teſtament, which are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to reſpect our Jeſus, are in themſelves ambiguos, and may by pregnant phanſies be</hi> applyed and fitted unto any ſubject.

They were avouched with greateſt confidence by his Apoſtles, who by thoſe means converted thouſands, and whoſe Records of theſe things became the rule of Faith unto the Chriſtian Converts. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this from the Miracles wrought by Chriſts Apoſtles, who affirm, Chriſt gave commiſſion to them whil'ſt abiding with them, to work the greateſt Miracles, which they accordingly performed. And that this Power
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:105209:131"/>was more abundantly conferr'd upon them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Reſurrection of their Lord, is argued from the Promiſe of Chriſt; from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Iews and Heathens; from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Scripture.

                  <p n="1">1. The Deſign on which our Saviour came into the World: For it was requiſite, that he who came to baffle and pull down the Devils Kingdom, ſhould ſhew his Power over thoſe evil Spirits which upheld it. Needful it was, that he who taught the World to ſlight and to deteſt thoſe Heathen Deities, which had ſo long obtained in the World, and had confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in their ſervice by ſeeming Miracles,<note place="margin">vid.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:105209:131"/>he was more worthy of their Adoration. And it was alſo requiſite, that he who gave it out that <hi>he came down from God</hi> to <hi>manifeſt the will of heaven to the world,</hi> ſhould by unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſigns of Gods aſſiſtance, prove the truth of his Commiſſion from him. And laſtly, It was requiſite, that he who came to null that Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> which was eſtabliſhed, or by the Jews conceived to be eſtabliſhed by many Miracles, ſhould give a greater proof of his Commiſſion from the God of Heaven, then were the Miracles of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, This will be farther evident, if we conſider that the Jews expected great and many Miracles from their <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> They tell us,<note place="margin">Midraſh Coheleth, in Eccleſ. <hi>1.11.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Jews and Heathens did in effect confeſs, that ſutably to theſe Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Prophets, and to the expectation
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:105209:132"/>of the Jews, they did work Miracles. For to aſcribe them to <hi rend="sup">1</hi>

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:105209:146"/>and malice of the Jew,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19. 3, 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1, 12.</note> and the Philoſophy of the Gentile, which it condemned as Folly, and its Authors as the worſt of fooles; and by the Sword of Emperours, ſtill glutted with the bloud of Chriſtians; and by the Rhetoricians Topicks of perſwaſion, and all the Machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both of men and Devils: I ſay it is not to be conceived, that ſuch a Doctrine ſhould by the means of Simple and Illiterate men, ſubject to many thouſand miſeries, <hi rend="sup">31</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute not only of that Eloquence which was ſo taking in thoſe days, but of all viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and apparent kindneſs from that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus for whom they di pretend to ſuffer; and void of all that might commend them to the World, or which might fit them either to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their Proſelytes, or to confound their Adverſaries: I ſay, that ſuch a Doctrine ſhould, by the means of Perſons ſo unqualified, ſpring forth and ſhoot like lightning from the Eaſt unto the Weſt, cancel the Ceremonies of the Jew, confound the Scepticiſme, and baffle all the Wiſdome of the Creeks, that it ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Rudeneſs of Barbarians in the ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt Myſteries, and change their Savage Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes unto the Chriſtian Charity and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; that it ſhould ſuddenly uſurpe the name of <hi rend="sup">32</hi>

                     </gap> or the <hi>Prevailing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> as <hi>Porphyry</hi> and others call it; that it
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:105209:146"/>ſhould ſhackle even the Prince of Darkneſs, and make his Kingdome fall more quick than lightning from the skies; that it ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due by ſufferings, and make the Scepter ſtoop and bow to the Croſs; that it ſhould <hi rend="sup">33</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the moſt part of the civilized World, in leſſer time than others take to travel over it; A world of ſo riveted by Laws, and Cuſtomes, and ſo enſlav'd by mulcts and penalties, to its Antient, and therefore Venerable Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo enthral'd to the Vaſſallage of Satan, and over-Grown in wickedneſs, and ſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of diſturbance; I ſay, that ſuch a Doctrine ſhould convert ſuch a World, by ſuch unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes, haveing no heavenly Power en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to aſſiſt it, but rather to confound it, if our adverſaries ſay true; and having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to be alledged by its Aſſertors, but the aſſiſtance or the holy Ghoſt, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their Saviours promiſe, that he would be with them, <hi>and Give a mouth and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to them which all their Adverſaries ſhould not be able to Gainſay;</hi> this of all matters of this nature muſt be moſt incredible, and is no leſs then a very Prodigy of Prodigies.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. THIS Argument depends on theſe Principles, which are confirmed to us by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Experience.</p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:105209:147"/>
                  <p n="1">1. That the ſtronger the prejudice is, the ſtronger muſt that power be which overcomes it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly, That a new Doctrine, which ſtands ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Great and many prejudices both of the Judgment and affections, and which contains many things, that ſeem to render it incredible to the one, and many more which render it unpleaſant to the other; and alſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers diſadvantage both from the infamy, and rudeneſs of its propagators, is moſt unlikely to prevail upon the World, in oppoſition to all other Doctrines.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly, That men are not eaſily induced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thoſe Principles, which they received from their Education, but ſtill are backward to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit new Faith, and to confeſs their Errours, and condemne themſelves, and paſs hard Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences upon the ſtate of their beloved Freinds, and their Relations, and their Anceſtours.</p>
                  <p n="4">4ly, That men are naturally wedded to their Luſts, and bear a paſſionate affection to the pleaſures and enjoyments of the World; and therefore that which ſuddenly prevailes upon them, to Renounce them all, muſt be of Greater Power, and of more prevailing Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, than the Temptations of the World.</p>
                  <p n="5">5ly, That as any diſtemper is more dangerous
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:105209:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>and more rooted and inveterate, ſo the nature of it is the more Malignant, and ſo much the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>onger and more efficacious muſt that Power be which effects its cure.</p>
                  <p n="6">6ly, That it is not eaſy to prevail upon the World to quit a preſent and important Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, only in hopes of future Good, to or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to the worſt of ſufferings in confirmation and purſuance of thoſe Hopes, without the moſt concluding Grounds of hope, much leſs in contradiction to them.</p>
                  <p n="7">7ly, That men of the loweſt Birth and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and ſuch as were Great Sufferers both in their Reputation and their Perſons, and thereforeſeem to be deſerted by that God they owned, were men unlikely to prevail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wiſe, and the inquiſitive Philoſophers, who examine things by Reaſon; upon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Stateſmen that conſider their Intereſt; upon the Magician and Sorcerer, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant and the Tradeſman, who meaſure things by their advantage and profit; upon the Gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and inconſtant multitude, which is led by the ſenſe and cuſtome and opinion of Perſons; upon the ſoft and tender Sex, the paſſionate and heady Youth the infirme and feeble Age; upon Perſons of all ſorts and conditions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to quit their Religion, and their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Luſts, their Worldly Intereſts, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:105209:148"/>their alluring Pleaſures, and their eſpouſed Tenets; much more their Livers and Dearer Relatives, and to expoſe themſelves unto thoſe evils, which are moſt contrary to the deſires of humane nature, and to the deſignes of meer natural men.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That when the Greateſt Potentates and Princes edged with the keeneſt malice, and aſſiſted by the Arts of Wit and Policy, Learning and Eloquence, and driving on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt deſignes to ruine, and extirpate ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable men, whoſe faith enjoyn'd them to endure all afflictions without the leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of the Civil Government, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to their Cruel and tyrannous Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: I ſay when Perſons of ſo Great ability and wiſdome, by all their ſubtilty and power, and all their other arts engaged againſt them, only encreaſed the number of thoſe men, whoſe utter extirpationthey intendedand purſued; 'tis rational to conclude, as they affirmed, that a more powerful hand was on their ſide, and <hi>that God had chooſen the fooliſh things of the World to confound the Wiſe, and weak things to confound the mighty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 3ly, IN confirmation of this Argument, it may deſerve to be conſidered, that albeit the wiſdome of the Heathe Philoſohers had
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:105209:148"/>nothing in it that ſeem'd to thwart the reaſon, or the affections and inclinations of mankind; albeit their divinity did not reproach what their Forefathers own'd; but was conſiſtent with all thoſe modes of worſhip which had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in every country; albeit it met with nothing to oppoſe and perſecute the firſt Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and the Promoters of it; but was encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by Kings and Princes, and had all the advantages of art and Rhetorick to ſet it off; and the engagements of the ſmoootheſt pens, and ſubtleſt heads to recommend it to the World; yet could it not preſent the world with any thing ſo well accommodated unto our natural apprehenſions, or any thing ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a Deity, &amp; ſo entirely fitted to the Good and welfare of mankind, as are the Chriſtians Faith and Precepts; nor yet obtain and ſpread it ſelf in many hundred years, through any pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thoſe Barbarous Nations, in which the Goſpel flouriſhed in the Apoſtles days; but in its flouriſhing condition was confined to <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> where it did either vaniſh of its own accord, or elſe concluded in Scepticiſme, or was ecclipſed by the appearance of the Goſpel light: and whileſt it did continue, 'tis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the compliants, confeſſions, and from the declarations of their Greateſt Sages, as well as Chriſtian Writers, how ineffectual
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:105209:149"/>it was to work a reformation on the world, how few of thoſe who were the Greateſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of it, live according unto what they writ, how rare a thing it was to find a <hi>Polemo</hi> or <hi>Phaedon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vid. Orig. in Celſ. l. <hi>3.</hi> pag. <hi>152</hi>
                     </note> or any other perſon, whoſe reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it had wrought. Since then the Chriſtian Doctrine, though ſtript of all thoſe fair advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which might commend it to the world, and clog'd with all the prejudices forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, did in the ſpace of forty yeares make ſuch a large diffuſion of it ſelf through many places, where ſcarce the name of a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher was known; and ſince it wrought ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable a change and reformation in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, lives, and manners, laws, and concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſo many millions; it may be rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought to be derived from that ſuperior Power to which all other ways of Worſhip do in vain pretend. Add to this, that none of the Philoſophers or of their chief admirers, would ſuffer for the truth of their aſſertion, or ſeal it with their bloud, none did pretend their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine derived from heaven, or that they had received the Gift of miracles or tongues, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the propagation, and to the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, unto ſucceeding Cenerations, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe acts they could deliver to them; whence evident it is they wanted all thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Arguments of credibility, which

               <p>§. 1. SHOULD it be here objected that Hereticks, and Heathens, <hi rend="sup">2</hi> 
                  <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and <hi rend="sup">1</hi> 
                  <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</hi> have been ſo ſignal and Renown'd for working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and for <hi rend="sup">3</hi> predictions of things future, that the <hi rend="sup">4</hi> wiſeſt ſages have been deceaved by them, and have <hi rend="sup">5</hi> eſteemed them Gods; and their Abettors have compared them with Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, as men of equal fame and power.

               <p>§. 2. IN refutation of theſe things, it is obvious to ſay, (1) That the world was in thoſe times of darkneſs very <hi rend="sup">12</hi> credulous, and apt to be impoſed upon, as it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe Fables which their Religion did eſpouſe.<note place="margin">Vid. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. de C. D. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>35.</hi> de doctr. Chriſt. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>23.</hi>
                  </note> (2) That God in Judgment might permit their ſeeming divinations, and pretended wonders (in poenam impiorum) that they whom the convincing evidence of Chriſtian Piety could not win to the recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth, might be deluded by a lye. (3) That the predictions to which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, were either ſo <hi rend="sup">13</hi> falſe, that they knew not when to believe them, or ſo <hi rend="sup">19</hi> obſcure, as to comply with any iſſue. That they were falſe, &amp; the reſult not of divine aſſiſtance but of chance, was confeſſ'd both by thoſe <hi rend="sup">17</hi> wiſer Heathens who reſorted to them, and by thoſe <hi rend="sup">14</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">18</hi> Prieſts who ſerved at the Altar, and attended on thoſe Oracles. Their obſcurity was the complaint, not only of the Poets, but the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:105209:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>and the <hi rend="sup">16</hi> Philoſophers, who did aſſert upon their own <hi rend="sup">15</hi> experience of them, that they had Generally either many ſenſes, or none that could be underſtood.

                  </gap>, not ſpeak the inſpirations of a Deity, but the deſires or intereſts of their Prieſts; who would be bribed or forced to anſwer any thing. But beſides all this, the Chriſtian Fathers tell us, that thoſe predict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were either Grounded on the <hi rend="sup">21</hi> Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God to his Prophets, or were the <hi rend="sup">22</hi> conjectures of the Devil bottomed on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, or naturall <hi rend="sup">23</hi> obſervations; or were preſent informations of thoſe ſpirits conveyed and told to their favourites of things that were acted on another Stage.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi rend="sup">24</hi> Miracles pretended it may be Anſwered. Firſt, that they were partly falſe, and ſuch as did <hi rend="sup">25</hi> ſerve the ends of nature, or the intereſts of man. (2.) That they were few and mean, <hi rend="sup">26</hi> unworthy to be brought into compariſon with thoſe of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and ſuch as hapily might not <hi rend="sup">27</hi> exceed the power of thoſe evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, whoſe intereſt it was to ſet them up in oppoſition unto Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and to whom they were <hi rend="sup">28</hi> aſcribed by the greateſt enemies of the Chriſtian Faith. (3.) The <hi rend="sup">29</hi>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:105209:158"/>diſeaſes which they cured, were only thoſe which their familiars did inflict and heal by ceaſing to inflict them, or thoſe which might be wrought by Phanſie, or humane skill, or by natural obſervations, and diabolicall aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and applications, without the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous power of God; All theſe, and many other Anſwers of this nature I ſhall wave, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting only upon ſuch as fundamentally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the force of theſe, and of ſuch like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
               <p>§ 3. 1. THAT all the great things aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to thoſe perſons have been <hi rend="sup">30</hi> ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blaſted, and they like Comets have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for a while to amaze the world, and preſently have ſet in darkneſs; nor <hi rend="sup">31</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able, nor ſo much as pretending to tranſmit this power which they vaunted of, to any other perſon, as our Saviour did in confirmation of his doctrine, or to leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them thoſe who by like actions ſhould atteſt the truth of what they did deliver; or <hi rend="sup">32</hi> ſuffer for the cauſe they owned. Which is a pregnant evidence that they derived from the Prince of darkneſs, and only feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a commiſſion from the King of Heaven. For can it be ſuppoſed that God, who wants not power or wiſdome to carry on his purpoſe
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:105209:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>and decrees, maugre all oppoſition that the world can make, ſhould not aſſiſt his meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in the tradition of that faith, which he commanded them to preach to the world; or doing ſo ſhould fail of his intended purpoſe, though <hi>working all things according to the pleaſure of his will?</hi> And yet this was the fate of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and other like Impoſtors; whilſt the Religion we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs was like the riſing ſun, which ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day; and the Apoſtles of our Lord out did their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and a continued throug of miracles did through divers centuries attend that Faith which they delivered to the world, as hath already been evinced.</p>
               <p>§ 4. 2ly. THAT the Adverſaries of the true Chriſtian Faith either <hi rend="sup">33</hi> wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> or ſomewhat equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repugnant to the concerns of real piety; and conſequently, it is ſure that Heaven
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:105209:159"/>would never ſet its ſeal unto them, or be ſo much concerned to propagate an Hell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Ground. Whereas the propagation of the Chriſtian Faith, was a thing worthy of the moſt pure and Holy God, as being the moſt lively tranſcript of his own perfections; and a moſt effectuall method to work the Soul into the Greateſt likeneſs to a Deity, and oppoſition to that Sin which he doth infinitely deteſt. For to walk <hi>worthy of this holy calling,</hi> is tolead a life of moſt Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick purity, abſtracted from all worldly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and anxious concerns for temporall things; to abound in meekneſs, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, long ſuffering, patience, and mercy, love, and charity; and to endeavour with the Greateſt care, to <hi>keep the unity of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the bond of peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. 3ly. I adde, that as for Hereticks and Heathens, providence controuled their attempts, and gave in evidence ſufficient to evince their vanity. It <hi rend="sup">36</hi> ſtruck dumb the ſtatue of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and the oracles of the Gentiles; it confounded <hi rend="sup">37</hi> 
                  <hi>Simon Magius,</hi> and in compliance with the Apoſtles prayers, put a concluſion to his miracles and life.</p>
               <p>§. 6. 4ly. That it was no concernment
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:105209:160"/>of mankind, to ſift theſe things before the coming of our Saviour; they oppoſed not their intereſts, their ſuperſtitions, luſts, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations; they did not go about to overturn all other wayes of worſhip, and to eſtabliſh new Laws of Government, and to ſubject the knowing wold to the humours and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of rude Mechanick Souls. But 1. The world found it neceſſary in order to the ends of Policy, that a Religion ſhould be kept on foot, and <hi rend="sup">38</hi> knew nothing better to ſtrike an awe upon the conſciences of men, than the religion then eſtaliſhed; and therefore had Juſt reaſon to conceal, but no inducement to diſcloſe its falſehood. 2ly. Who e're ſhould venture to oppoſe what was ſo Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally own'd, muſt have done it without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. For they might well expect the Greateſt oppoſition and affronts from men, nor could they promiſe to themſelves aſſiſtance from an higher power in propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other doctrine.</p>
               <p>§. 7. 5ly. Twas the concernment of the swicked one, thus to confirm their ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Idolatrous worſhip, and their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and brutiſh ceremonies, and give in his aſſiſtance towards the propagation of thoſe hereſies which did <hi>evert the Faith of Christ.</hi>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:105209:160"/>This was to propagate and to uphold his kingdome, and put a fatall ſtop to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing influence of Chriſtian Faith. It was alſo the concernment of all Heathen Prieſts; they got their Honours and revenues by it, &amp; therefore all thoſe ſeeming miracles, and thoſe pretended divinations this objection mentions, may be preſumed to derive from him, who is the Great deceaver of the world; and to whoſe power, arts, and ſubtilty, the Fathers do ſo oft aſcribe them, or from the skill and <hi>Magick</hi> of thoſe Prieſts, who ſerved at his Altars.</p>
               <p>§. 8. <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. If the Miracles of Chriſt were ſo Great, and many, and if He ſo viſibly performed all that the ſcriptures had foretold and ſpoken of the true Meſſiah: If his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine were ſo holy, his life ſo full of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and obliging Charity, is it not matter of aſtoniſhment, that of that Nation, which was then big with expectations of a Saviour, and did ſo readily embrace falſe Chriſts, which ſaw the miracles he did, were the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his pity, and living monuments of his power, ſo few embraced his doctrine, ſo many did reject and blaſt him as a deceaver, and a Malefactor?</p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:105209:161"/>
               <p>§. 9. <hi>Anſ.</hi> WE ſhall have little reaſon to admire this iſſue of our Saviours coming, if we conſider, (1) the temper and the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of thoſe men with whom he had to do; whoſe promiſes being moſtly carnall, their minds were wholly bent on Riches, Victory, Grandeur,<note place="margin">

And as a juſt reſult of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, their diſobedience and deafneſs to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of their holy Prophets, they were
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:105209:161"/>men given up by Gods juſt Judgments to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe and blindneſs. Hence holy Scripture tells us, that the deſtruction which befell them was that to which <hi>they were deſigned;</hi> they being <hi>Veſſels fitted for it;</hi>

               <p>§. 10. AND 2ly. We ſhall have little reaſon to admire this iſſue of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Preaching to the Jews, if we conſider the danger to which it expoſed them. To own him for the true Meſſiah,<note place="margin">

                  <p>COncluding for the truth of Chriſtian Doctrine from the excellency of its Precepts, <label type="milestone">

Firſt, by the cleareſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations of man's underſtanding in matters which concerne the knowledge of God, &amp; of Virtue and Vice. And ſecondly, by tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt prevailing motives to engage the will and the affections to obedience. And thirdly, the moſt ſtrong engagements to ſeek the welfare of our Brother's Soul. Heathen Philoſophy and their receiv'd Theologie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of Religion, and fitted to promote the Intereſt of Satans kingdome. This prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their conceptions both of God, and of his Providence, and of his Attributes, and their uncertainty in Matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from their want of precepts to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:105209:171"/>them in, or promiſe to encourage to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their duty; &amp; from their doubtings of a future State, and their denial of all future puniſhments, and from their falſe concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the riſe and fatality of Sin. That theſe opinions are deſtructive to the ſervice of a Deity, and the concernments of Religion. That they received opinions which deſtroyed mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. This proved from their miſtakes and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. <hi>(1.)</hi> Touching the duties and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of love &amp; charity to their neighbour And ſecondly touching the laws of Chaſtity, Juſtice, and of truth. Heathen Philoſophy proved ineffectual, not only to reforme the world, but the Profeſſors of it. The wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their lives. The accounts and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of it. Thereſult of all in confirmation of the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. BUT that which is the Crown of all, and indeed <hi>potiſſima demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratio,</hi> a moſt convincing evidence of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the holy Spirit towards the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Goſpel, is the excellency of the Chriſtian precepts, and the ſubſervience they bear, not only to our future, but to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent welfare.</p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:105209:171"/>
               <p>§. 2. IT were endleſs to inſiſt upon the incredible Power of Chriſtianity, when cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially embraced, to ſheath the Sword, &amp; beat it into plow-ſhares, to ſtill contentions, and bind the hand to its good behaviour, to prevent all waies of being cruel to our neighbours life, or prejudicial to his eſtate and Fortunes, or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to his name or honour, by taking up or venting a reproach againſt him, or by diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Errors and infirmities which Charity doth bind us to conceal. It were infinite to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thoſe liberal proviſions it hath made for Love and Charity, pity and compaſſion, and whatſoever may indear my Brother to me, and draw forth all my powers to aſſiſt him. It gives the truly generous and publick Spirit; it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands every man to ſeek his Brothers weal, and ſhew him all that kindneſs, which he could expect or beg, when under like neceſſity. It bids us <hi>burn, when others are afflicted, and weep with thoſe that weep;</hi> That is, it bids us be as forward to relieve them under all their preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and afflictions, as if their afflictions were our own. Now what can further be required to our preſent happineſs, than the ſecurity of what a preſent we enjoy from any hand of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and the aſſurance of our Brothers help towards the enjoyment of the thing we want:
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:105209:172"/>Nor is it leſs conducive to the publick good. Chriſtianity gives ſuch a reliſh of ſublimer Bliſs, as diſintangleth the more noble Soul from all the trivial concernes of earth. It tells us that the freindſhip of this world is enmity to God, that he who beares affection to theſe earthly things, is but pretender to the love of heaven. It inſpires into us that contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which allayes the hell &amp; torment of an inordinate &amp; ſtill ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping appetite. It transformes the man into humility and meekneſs, and ſo prevents the tumult &amp; diſturbance of the haughty Spirit. It enforceth peace upon us by the ſtrongeſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and threatneth an eternal flame to the Incendiary. It moulds the Soul into a ſimple honeſt, and ſincere deportment, and interdicts thoſe flattering Addreſſes, which belye the thoughts and Conſcience of the Speaker; and more then this it cannot do in order to our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick welfare, ſince that can never ſuffer, but from unjuſt and treacherous, factious and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent, proud worldly or rapacious Spirits.</p>
               <p>§. 3. CHRISTIANITY is a Religion high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfective of humane nature, and ſuch as beſt comports with the concernments of our Souls, and moſt advanceth its moſt noble faculties.</p>
               <p>It gives the beſt diſcoveries of the Divine exiſtence, and of Providence, and of that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and homage which we owe unto a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:105209:172"/>and of thoſe attributes which are the only grounds, and moſt prevailing motives to it; <hi>viz.</hi> The Truth and Freedome, the Juſtice, Power, Goodneſs, the Wiſdome, Unity, and Omnipreſence of a Deity; all which muſt be entirely owned as the foundations of reall Piety. It preſents us with ſuch admirable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of Wiſdome, Juſtice, Goodneſs, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Compaſſion, in the contrivance and procurement of Pardon and Salvation to us by the death of Chriſt, as Judaiſme could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver boaſt. It holds forth the cleareſt light to guide our darke and purblind Reaſon into the paths of vertue, and to ſecure us from the ſplitting rocks of Vice. It gives the beſt and largeſt Comment upon thoſe duties of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, which are ſo imperfectly and ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely hinted by the light of nature, and ſo much queſtioned and diſputed by the Gentile World, as wee ſhall ſee hereafter. It diſcovers to us thoſe impediments which would retard and clog us in the performance of our duty, that ſo we may avoid them. It makes the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil thought as guilty as the evil action, and calls as much for purity of heart, and freedome from every vile affection, as from thoſe actions that doe iſſue from them. It ſetleth the float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul on the firm Baſis of divine veracity; and for the Heathens faint ſurmiſes, and the Jews
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:105209:173"/>darker ſhaddowes of good things to come, it gives the Chriſtians lively hopes, and full aſſurances of Faith. It tenders the holy Spirit as an earneſt of our future bliſs, and aſſures us if we doe the will of heaven, we ſhall know what is ſo. In fine, the knowledge of a future endleſs bliſs and miſery, is the reſult of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel revelation, which upon all theſe grounds doth beſt provide for the information of our underſtanding, in what it is concern'd to know in order to our future happineſs; to wit, the being of a God, and our engagement to adore and ſerve him: what will procure his Favour, and will provoke his Indignation, and what concernes we have ſincerely to avoide the one, and to purſue the other.</p>
               <p>§. 4. NEXT it preſents the Will, with the moſt ſoveraigne motives and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto duty, and bindes that on us with moſt powerful cords of Love, and the amazing mercies of our God and Saviour; The obligations of repeated vows, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, eſpecially of thoſe of Baptiſme, and the Sacred Euchariſt; the convictions of our conſcience, the laws and Sanctions of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who ſtrikes an awe upon it, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Saviours which doth at once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to our obedience, and provoke us to it.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:105209:173"/>It pains forth ſin to us in its own dreſs, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the dangers of preſent, and a dreadful expectation of eternal miſeries; and thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced by all the aggravations which love and mercy, conſcience and duty, the light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and religion, the experience of our ſelves and others can afford it. It preſents Goodneſs to us in its faireſt and moſt tempting aſpects, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us that the ways of God are Good &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, ſafe and eaſie, and full of comfort and preſent ſatisfaction to the Soul. It courts the affections with the moſt admirable delights that heaven can tender, it ſurrounds us with the pleaſures of a virtuous life, the joys of charity, the comforts of an upright conſcience, the ſmiles of heaven, and its concernment for the good man's welfare here and happineſs hereafter; ſuch happineſs as far exceeds what we are able to conceive. It blows off all our prejudices, buoys up the ſinking Spirit with freſh ſupplies of grace and ſpiritual aſſiſtance, and all the comforts of a never failing promiſe, that <hi>God will never leave us nor forſake us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5.</note>but will make the heavieſt of afflictions be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to <hi>work together for our good.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.</note> It quells all feares &amp; Jealouſies of the deſponding Spirit, by giving full aſſurance of our pardon on the moſt reaſonable and eaſy termes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting our heavenly Father, not only wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:105209:174"/>to receive, but ſo gracious as to invite the Prodigal. It rendreth our diſcouragements the beſt of motives, aſſuring us that our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions will augment our joys, and that our thorns will bloſſom into crownes of glory. And what can weigh againſt ſuch powerful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, when life the firſt of mercies, and the foundation of all others, and death the laſt and moſt dreadful evil, are ſuch low trifles, as are not worthy to be compared to them:</p>
               <p>§. 5. AGEN, it layes the higheſt obligations on us to endeavour the welfare of our Brothers Soul.<note place="margin">

Morality was either wholy ſlighted, and Vice or Vertue deemed to be only what humane

               <p>§. 9. 3ly, THE <hi rend="sup">25</hi> Stoick and the School of <hi>Epicurus</hi> held that God is a corporeal Being, which muſt exceedingly degrade him in the conceptions of man-kind. They <hi rend="sup">26</hi> univerſally fancied him to be of humane ſhape, and ſo they chang'd the image of the incorruptible God into the likeneſs of a corruptible man, &amp; hence they deemed an <hi rend="sup">27</hi> Image requiſite unto the worſhip of a Deity, and would reproach the Chriſtians, and pronounce them Atheiſts for defect of it. They took the boldneſs to <hi rend="sup">28</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and confine Gods power, and diſpute his omnipreſence, they held him <hi rend="sup">29</hi> unable to do any thing without the help of matter, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to <hi rend="sup">30</hi> correct thoſe evil diſpoſitions to which it inclined us. They owned an evil and pernicious God of equal power with, and independent on the God of heaven; who, as they thought, was inſufficient to reſtrain the actions of this <hi rend="sup">31</hi> evil principle. Thus did they make vice looſe its name by being neceſſary, and leave us all in miſery, becauſe inevitably
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:105209:177"/>ſubject to the power of this pernicious being. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> bound up God in the Chaines of unalterable fate; the <hi rend="sup">32</hi> 
                  <hi>Peripatetick</hi> made him not to act at all, or elſe to do it from the <hi rend="sup">23</hi> neceſſity of his nature; both which are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually repugnant to his worſhip, and to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture both of vice and virtue; They doubted of his omnipreſence, and by ſo doing made it doubtful whether our ſupplications could be heard, and he become a preſent help in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi rend="sup">34</hi> The Platoniſt would not permit him to be free in the expreſſions of his Goodneſs, and ſo they rob'd us of thoſe motives, which the conſideration of that freedome doth afford; ſome thought he could <hi rend="sup">35</hi> conceive no anger, and therefore could not puniſh ſinne; others conceived him ſo ſevere and froward that he could never be atoned; the firſt ſpake comfort and encouragement unto the vileſt ſinner, and made all Gods threats to be but <hi>bruta fulmina;</hi> the other did as much diſcourage all inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to bee good. <hi rend="sup">36</hi> Prayer was rejected as a uſeleſs thing, not only by the ſchool of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi> which renounced providence, and by the <hi>Stoicks fate;</hi> but alſo by the <hi rend="sup">37</hi>

Thus did they bind the world to thoſe rites, which whilſt they did obſerve, they muſt be hateful and reproachful to a Deity, and infinitely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from that Piety which chiefly doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in being like him; For what is more<note n="a" place="margin">Cum enim pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum jacitur in Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pem patriae bonum atque utilem, nonne tanto eſt indignius, quanto à veritate remotius &amp; à vita illius alienius; quae igitur ſupplicia ſufficiunt, cum deo fit iſta tam notoria tam inſignis injuria?

               <p>§. 13. FOR firſt, ſince hope and feare are the two radical and leading paſſions of the ſoul; ſeeing the expectations of reward, or future Good, and dread of future evil, are the two ſoveraigne motives to the renouncing of a luſt, or the embracing of a virtuous life; who
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:105209:181"/>ever comes to God in way of duty, <hi>muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is, and that he is a rewarder of all thoſe that diligently ſeek him.</hi> And ſure that homage may be ſpared which brings me in on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my labour for my paines, and the complaint of <hi>David</hi> that he did <hi>cleanſe his hands in vaine</hi> muſt be allowed of, if with like fredome from vindictive juſtice, and as much temporal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of himſelfe, he might have imbrued them in his Brothers blood.

               <p>§. 14. NAY ſeeing God is an all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Being, and therefore able to diſpenſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments according to our workes; what ever can induce me to believe he will not do it, muſt alſo force me to conclude that he is wholly careleſs in thoſe matters; that he doth not love that virtue, which he will not crown, defend, and cheriſh: nor hate that vice, which he will not reſtraine and puniſh; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt natural reſult of hatred to ſhew a Great diſpleaſure, and where our power is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to our will, to leave ſome tokens of diſlike and oppoſition to what we hate, by our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſuppreſſe and cruſh it. As on the other hand it is the genuine effect of love to wiſh and to endeavour, where our power meets with nothing to controul it, the preſervation and welfare of the object loved. And therefore it is folly to conceive that Gratitude ſhould lead me to the purſuance of that virtue which will not be Grateful, or the forbearance of that vice, which cannot poſſibly diſpleaſe the Perſon to whom I ſtand obliged to expreſs my gratitude.</p>
               <p>§. 15. 2ly, SINCE evident it is, that <hi>all things here do come alike to all, and there is one event unto the just and unjuſt.</hi> Since it is not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience only, but the complaint and ſcandal
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:105209:182"/>of the world, that wicked perſons flouriſh in it <hi>like a green bay tree;</hi> that they are fat and well liking, and often have a late and quiet paſſage to their Graves. In a word ſince here we finde no diſpenſations of rewards or puniſhments, according to the Good or bad demeanours of mankind; it follows, that thoſe doctrines which deny the future being of the ſoule, and make its bliſs or miſery conclude with its exiſtence in the body, muſt render Piety not only uſeleſs, but oft deſtructive to the intereſt both of the ſoul and body, and ſo repugnant to our reaſon.</p>
               <p>§. 16. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, SINCE all rewards diſpenſed by the hand of providence muſt be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of actions, ordered according to God's will and precepts, and tending to his honour; and ſeeeing all the puniſhments inflicted by Him, muſt be the products of ſuch actions as bear an oppoſition to his will, and ſo are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per acts of diſobedience; (it being inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the wiſdome, as well as with the juſtice of a God, to give rewards to what doth infinitely diſpleaſe him, and reflects on him with diſhonour;) to leave the ſoule uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his will, muſt clip the wings of the moſt fledg'd devotion. For when beholding the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of men's inventions to appeaſe a Diety, and pay their homage to him, their ſoul could
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:105209:183"/>only pitch on one, and that as diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as the reſt; it muſt be either temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to put the matter to a venture, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Gods' ſervice, or elſe be ſcar'd into ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, or an immoderate dread of God. For what can free the ſoul from endleſs terrours, when it can arrive at no ſecurity, that what it doth, is acceptable to that God, from whom it muſt expect a future and eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, according to its actions in this life.</p>
               <p>§. 17. 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, SEING the will is guided by the convictions of the judgment, where this doth doubt and fluctuate, its influence upon the will, eſpecially when tempted to oppoſe its dictates by the ſtrongeſt paſſions and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſoul, and by all the pleaſures of our ſenſes, muſt be inconſiderable. For whether we are moved by hopes or feares, the terrours of an evil threatned, or the expectations of a future good; the more our doubtings are of what we hope or feare, the leſſe our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are convinc'd or ſatisfied, and ſo much the leſs able they are to prevail, or ſtand their ground againſt the ſtrength of our affections and the importunity of our paſſions.</p>
               <p>§. 18. 5ly, SINCE what it is not in my power to avoid, it cannot be my duty to avoid,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:105209:183"/>and what doth follow from the laws of fate, and thoſe extrinſick cauſes whoſe operations are immutable, is alſo unavoidable, it follows, that thoſe doctrines which make our ſinful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to proceed from ſuch a cauſe, muſt make it ceaſe to be my duty to avoid them.</p>
               <p>§. 19. THE Heathen had as groſs concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in matters of morality, as of Religion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, they embraced opinions which thwarted all the duties of the ſecond table, and acted ſutably to thoſe opinions.

Whereas the lives of Heathens after all arts and ſubtilties, inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Rhetorick and demonſtrations, which their Philoſophy could boaſt of, were ſutable unto their looſe opinions, and Guilty of moſt vile enormities.

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:105209:188"/>many made the pleaſure of the mind to vail to them.</p>
               <p>§. 28. 5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> THE Philoſophers were ſo taken up with contemplations as to neglect Morality, Hence we are told that Socrates <hi rend="sup">107</hi> firſt introduced it into familys, and towns, and countreys, and made it matter of the Schools enquiry, the iſſue of their diſquiſitions was too often this, that there was <hi rend="sup">108</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing juſt or unjuſt in it ſelf <hi rend="sup">108</hi> but as the Laws of Nations by their peculiar conſtitutions made it ſo: Or that the truth in matters of this nature could be hardly found, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was wiſdome to embrace what they already found eſtabliſhed.</p>

                  <p>PROLEGOMENA in order to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Reſurrection of our Lord. <hi>1.</hi> That the Apoſtles did preſently atteſt the thing. <hi>2.</hi> This atteſtation could not be a bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced and notorious lye. Arg. <hi>1.</hi> from the teſtimony. Arg. <hi>2.</hi> from theſe <hi>3</hi> conſiderations. <hi>1.</hi> that our Saviours body did not continue in the ſepulcher when they proclaimed him riſen. <hi>2.</hi> That his Diſciples did not conveigh his body thence. Nor <hi>3.</hi> was that done by any other perſons who had no relation to Chriſt, and no affection for him.

               </argument>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:105209:217"/>
               <p>AND thus we have diſpatch'd our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of the Chriſtian Faith. We now proceed unto that Article of it from which we may infer the reſt, viz. The Reſurrection of our bleſſed Saviour. Which that we may conclude with Greater evidence, we premiſe,</p>
               <p>§. 1. THAT the Apoſtles did preſently atteſt the thing. The predictions of our Lord and Saviour, own'd by the malice of the Jew, and all their vain endeavours to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent what he foretold touching his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; the expectation of his friends, and that abundant ſatisfaction which they found in this particular; the early records of the Chriſtians Story, and Symbols of his faith, which every where inculcate it, all theſe give in a full aſſurance of this truth. Nay had the knowledge of his reſurrection been defer'd beyond that period which he himſelf had fixed, how impoſsible had it been to have cajold the world into ſo firme and ſtedfaſt a belief of the particular circumſtances? to have held up the drooping Spirits, &amp; baffled hopes of his diſciples? or to have kept the inſulting Jew from giving viſible demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the vanity of their pretenſions, or from crying out of the impoſture. Could his
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:105209:217"/>Diſciples be aſſured of his reſurrection, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent apparitions of him, and not endeavour to acquaint the world with what ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the truth of his predictions, and their hopes, &amp; which was of ſo great importance to mankind, and could not be neglected by the Diſciples of our Lord, &amp; they be faithfull unto the commiſſion which they pretended? Or could they be ſo quick &amp; nimble to conveigh his body from the ſepulcher, and yet their tongues be backward to proclaim him riſen? Would intereſt or reaſon ſuffer them to pull the greateſt prejudice on their cauſe, to blaſt their Growing hopes, and fruſtrate their bold adventure by an undue concealment of what their Maſters promiſe and predictions had made ſo neceſſary to be divulged? But</p>
               <p>§. 2. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> I premiſe that common prudence would not ſuffer the Diſciples of this JESUS, to pretend ſuch things in confirmation of their teſtimony, which muſt infallibly render it the ſcorn and hatred of the world. Wherefore they could not poſſibly pretend ſuch things were newly acted on a publick ſtage, and in the face of their profeſſed adverſaries, which owed their being only to their phancies, and of which their ſtory gave the firſt account unto the world. For men to certify to all Jeruſalem, that lately there was ſuch a man

               <p n="4">4ly. This teſtimony avouched a thing no ſooner done than certified to the world; and the ſame Theatre which ſaw it acted, heard it as ſoon proclaimed to the face of the profeſſed adverſaries of Chriſt. Earthquakes, and apparitions of dead men, the conſternations of the watch, and their confeſſions thereupon; the teſtimony of five hundred men eye witneſſes of his aſcenſion, (and many of them living when St <hi>Paul</hi> indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>) were all produced in evidence of the fact; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore means of information could not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this caſe to thoſe that ſought them. For can we think thoſe Jews who perſecuted <hi>Paul</hi> whilſt preaching in the Synagogues of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> and afterwards impeached him at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> would not enquire into the truth of this his confident report among them; or that St <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be ſo wholly void of reaſon, as to divulge a lye ſo palpable, in ſuch a place where there were Jews abundant to evince its falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and in an Epiſtle to be read in <hi>all the Churches of the World.</hi>

               <p>And yet this teſtimony ſo incredible in it ſelf, ſo contradicted by the Jew, ſo punctual, and yet ſo various in its circumſtances, ſo freſh in its delivery, which underwent ſo critical and ſevere a ſcrutiny; I ſay this teſtimony found a reception more incredible than it ſelf. For the bare relation of it converted thouſands, which nothing but the inſuperable force of truth, and the more pierceing influence of Heaven could ſo miraculouſly have effected.</p>
               <p>§. 4. OUR ſecond demonſtration of the Reſurrection of our Saviour, will ariſe from three concluſions. Firſt that our Saviours bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was removed from the Grave. For its conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance there muſt ſurely have diſcovered the falſehood of this bold aſſertion, and made all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways of confirmation of it, not only need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but abſurd, whilſt by an ocular demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any one might have perceived the truth, and diſcovered the impudent folly of all thoſe, who durſt affirm that it was riſen from the dead.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. The diſciples of our Saviour cannot be juſtly charg'd with its conveiance from the Sepulcher, for (beſides the no advantage, nay the aſſurance of the worſt of miſeries which could attend the promulgation of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;) they dream'd of a Meſſiah who ſhould
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:105209:220"/>ſway the Scepter, and <hi>ſubdue the Nations under them;</hi> and when they found it otherwiſe, their hopes lay buried in his Grave, and expired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him. After ſuch manifold expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of their Maſters power to aſſiſt them by an Almighty hand; after their ſolemne proteſtations made to own him in the ſharpeſt tryals, they ſhamefully deſerted him, and at firſt aſſault betook themſelves to their heeles; their Prolocutor renounced him, and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his denyal with an oath; they barr'd their dores, and hid their heads, dreading every thing they heard or ſaw. And can it be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that perſons ſo extreamly timerous ſhould hazard their lives to reſcue his dead body from the Grave, who after all obligement both of faith and duty, did ſo little to preſerve him from it, againſt a watch ſo vigilant, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly concerned to prevent the miſchiefs of a ſecond, and therefore more pernitious error? After commands ſo ſtrict &amp; peremptory to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Sepulcher, in vain muſt they attempt to rifle it; which if any ſay they did whileſt the watchmen ſlept, how came they privy to it, what credit can their word deſerve? if whilſt they waked, what could induce thoſe watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to make lyes their refuge and wilfully permit the cheat? Beſides it is a timerous trade to play the thief, much more to rob the Grave
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:105209:221"/>of its Inhabitants, and they might well expect that vengeance ſhould arreſt them in a fact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to delude the world, and to entitle God unto the worſt of villanies, and hence not only their reſpect unto their Maſter, but their own ſafety muſt have taught them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch their buſineſs, and not to ſpend their time in the uncaſing of his body, and rowling up the Napkins that were about his head, and to do things of ſuch needleſs curioſities.</p>
               <p>But 3ly more incredible it is, that perſons unconcerned for this Jeſus ſhould run ſo great an hazard, or be concerned to remove his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thence; or that the Apoſtles ſhould bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom all their hopes on ſuch a tottering foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, &amp; truſt to the fidelitie of thoſe men, who in this very buſines, in which their ſilence could alone befriend them, were the worſt of cheats. Tis laſtly moſt incredible that perſons of this temper ſhould ſtill go on to ſtifle and conceal the matter, and not be tempted by the pleaſure of the thing, the ſervice they might do to their Religion, the hopes of a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reward, or by the hatred of a cheat ſo Groſs and palpable, to manifeſt the ſhame and infamy of thoſe that forged it. Beſides how could his own Diſciples hope by mighty ſigns and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, by Gifts and Graces of the Holy Spirit, great &amp; numerous, to give in evidence unto his
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:105209:221"/>Reſurrection (which they confidently preten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded) had he been ſtill reſerved under the power of death, and only by their own or others art reoved from his Sepulcher? How is it that they never thought within themſelves, he could not ſave himſelf, and whence ſhall we expect Salvation? He could not by his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of power and Goodneſs prevail upon one Nation to believe his Doctrine, and can we, though deſtitute of all that power which reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in him, think to reduce the world into obedience, or to impart the Holy Ghoſt to others, when we our ſelves have the Spirit of deluſion only? Nay might not the example of <hi>Theudas, Judas,</hi> and many others (both of their own and other Nations) all whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours (although their hopes and their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities were greater and their undertaking leſs) proved unſuccesful, and ended in the ruine of thoſe bold adventurers, be ſufficient to deter them from ſuch bold attempts? Lo here a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony which gives the Greateſt evidence to it ſelf, and yet aſſerted by ſuch men, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their would deceive, nor were deceived in this particular, and conſequenty whoſe atteſtation could be no deceit. Which that it may appear with greater evidence,</p>
               <p>Conſider firſt, That they pretended to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and infallible convictions of the Truth, to
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:105209:222"/>frequent apparitions of this Jeſus, attended with ſome ſignal circumſtance to evidence their truth unto them, and gae it out that they <hi>converſed with him fourty daies,</hi> ſaw many Miracles done by him, received inſtructions from his mouth, to <hi>feed his Sheep,</hi> to <hi>teach all Nations and Baptize them.</hi> Yea that they were endowed with power from him to confirm the teſtimony by <hi>mighty ſignes and wonders,</hi> and for the truth of this they frequently appeal'd unto their adverſaries, and the experience of thoſe who did embrace their Doctrines; in all which confident appeals and atteſtations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring little more then eyes and ears to certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the truth unto them, tis equally incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible they ſhould deceive or be deceived.</p>
               <p>Did they give credit to this <hi>Jeſus,</hi> they muſt conclude him riſen according to his own prediction, and therefore could not be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in aſſerting it? Did they conclude him an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> what motives could they have to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh him the Saviour of the World, who after he had call'd them to leave all and follow him, and made ſuch ample Promiſes unto them <hi>of Judging the twelve Tribes of Iſrael,</hi> left them ſo ſadly in the lurch, expoſed unto ſhame and infamy? Did they give credit to the Sacred Oracles, and reverence the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> why did they not dread thoſe Judgements which
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:105209:222"/>God proclaimed againſt the falſe and lying Prophet? if they did not believe it, why were they ſo concerned for the Truth of the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Law concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as to aſſert them with the loſs both of the freedome and ſafety of their lives?</p>
               <p>Should we aſcribe the cheat unto the powers of imagination, (ſince they pretended to be <hi>eye witneſſes of the Reſurrection,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver nothing but what they ſaw and heard) is it not ſtrange to think that Phancy ſhould create a perſon to them frequently appearing, preaching, and inſtructing, giveing out com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, adminiſtring of holy Ordinances, and the like; that it ſhould draw them out unto the mount of <hi>Olives</hi> after an aery Phantaſm, and then preſent it, carryed up into Heaven? In ſhort, they were certain his body was not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately conveyed away by their endeavours, and that this only was pretended to diſgrace their teſtimony, and what could farther be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to aſſure both them and us, that they were not deceived? To Conclude,</p>
               <p>If this relation were untrue either they were beſide their ſenſes when they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or beſides their wits when they affirm'd it, and did endeavour to confirm what they did not believe with loſs of life and fortunes; and if ſo, what ſhall we ſay to the world
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:105209:223"/>of Chriſtians, that maugre all temptations to the contrary did ſtedfaſtly believe theſe men, who had ſo little reaſon to believe themſelves? It is prodigious to think, that a poor ignorant young man, of meaneſt birth and breeding, of a moſt hateful Nation, and hated by that Nation to the death, becauſe pretending that he was a Prophet ſent from God, and after this his death, only avouched to be ſo by twelve Fiſhermen, pretending with loud boaſts of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, falſe as God is true, to teſtifie his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, though a greater falſhood, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to all that would believe it nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this power of working Miracles, but death and miſeries at preſent, which their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience proved to be true: I ſay, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious to think, that He and his Diſciples ſhould with no other charmes worke ſuch a laſting Faith in all the wiſeſt part of men, that neither time nor vice, though moſt concerned to do ſo, ſhould ever be able to deface it. And yet what's ſo prodigiouſly incredible, muſt be certain truth, or elſe the Reſurrection muſt be ſo.</p>

               <head type="sub">SHEWING that if what hath been delivered ſhould be only probable, yet the Chriſtian Faith muſt in all reaſon be embraced, as being, 1. the ſafeſt way, and 2ly the greateſt inſtrument of preſent Happines.

               <p>And(1) CHRISTIANITY is the beſt help to preſent happines, becauſe it gives the higheſt motives to contentment in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, the ſtrongeſt comforts and ſupports againſt thoſe evils we can fear or ſuffer,

               </p>
               <p>Beſides, all other waies of Worſhip, which ſtand in competition with it, are ſo abſurd, or ſurely antiquated, as not to bear the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Evidence, compared to the Evidence of Chriſtian Faith: and therefore we may reſt aſſured, that if there be a Providence, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be offended with us for preferring this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: But God may juſtly be incenſed againſt us, for not embracing of the Chriſtian Faith, though the Inducements ſo to do were only probable, becauſe we proſecute the moſt important Actions and Affaires of humane life upon the like Inducements. We goe to ſea only
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:105209:224"/>in hopes of a good Voyage, and a ſafe returne, and have recourſe to the Phyſician only in hopes of a recovery, and therefore cannot be excuſed, if we neglect to do what we have like or greater reaſon to believe is both the will of God, and that which doth conduce to our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happines: eſpecially conſidering that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity doth promiſe greater meaſures of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and degrees of Evidence to ſuch as do obey its Precepts; aſſuring us that <hi>he who doth the Will of Chriſt, ſhall know the Doctrine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of God or not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. IF then it be but probable, that Chriſt and his Diſciples were endowed with any Power of working Miracles in confirmation of the Chriſtian Faith, that any of them healed diſeaſes, caſt out devils, raiſed the Dead, and whilſt they conſtantly pretended to theſe things for many generations, and in all places of the World, and did avouch them with their deareſt blood, were not the worſt of <hi>fools</hi> and <hi>knaves,</hi> or moſt deluded perſons. Or if it be but probable that ſuch Men could never leave unto the world the beſt and the ſublimeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, ſuch as outdid the Laws of wiſeſt Nations and all the Precepts of Philoſophy, ſuch as beſt ſerve the preſent and eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of Man, ſuch as are moſt conſiſtent with
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:105209:225"/>the common Principles of Reaſon, and yet too hard for reaſon to invent. If it be probable that they could never by the bare Aſſertion of the Reſurrection of a <hi>condemned malefactor</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed only by a lye) prevail upon the world to owne him for their God, to deſert all other ways of Worſhip, and to run the greateſt risks at preſent, only in expectation of ſome future Bleſſing, which he had promiſed in another life. If it be probable that ſuch a world of men would never ſuffer fiery tryals, and ſundry kinds of death, become the ſcorne, and the Ofscouring of the world, only to propagate that lye which ſcarce afforded a temptation ſo to do. If it be probable that any real Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were inflicted upon the Enemies of the Chriſtian Faith, or upon ſuch as did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate in the profeſſion of it, or that the Church, and chiefly the Apoſtles, had power to inflict ſuch Judgments, and did not terrify their converts vith vain words. If it be proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any Revelations have been ever made in favour of the Chriſtian Cauſe,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 29, 30, 31, 32.</note> and that S. Paul in his Epiſtles to the Church of Corinth, doth not give directions about things of nought, and confidently tell them that ever one had a Revelation, when no man did enjoy it. If it be probable that any Dreams or Viſions have been vouchſafed to them, or any tokens
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:105209:225"/>of divine Aſſiſtance under ſufferings, of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful deliverance from them, of confuſion to their Adverſaries. If it be probable that the predictions of the Meſſiah of the Jews were perfectly accompliſh'd in our JESUS; and that things particularly foretold by him (viz. his Death and Reſurrection, the large and ſpeedy Propagation of the Chriſtian Faith, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of his Diſciples, the deſtruction of the Jewiſh nation) however moſt incredible, were moſt aſſuredly fulfill'd, or that that gift of Propheſie, to which ſo many thouſand ſoules pretended throughout divers centuryes, was really vouchſafed to any one of them. If it be probable that any of them ſpake with Tongues, and the Apoſtle did not charge the Church of Corinth with the too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent exerciſe of a gift with which they never were acquainted. If it be probable that the whole Sect of Chriſtians for three hundred years were neither wicked Impoſtors, nor yet deluded Perſons. If it be probable that they had no aſſiſtance from good or evil Angels to delude the World, and yet did things which could not be effected without the aid of ſome ſupernaturall Powers. If it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that both their Goſpels and Epiſtles were indited in that Age they lived in, and ſent to thoſe Perſons to whome they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:105209:226"/>and if it be improbable that whilſt ſo many were alive that could atteſt the truth or falſehood of their ſtory, it ſhould, though a prodigious and bare-faced lye, obtain to be the Rule of Faith. I ſay if all theſe things are probable, then muſt Chriſtianity be highly probable; and if it ought to be embraced upon the Probability of any one, the Probability of all theſe Circumſtances muſt give an ample confirmation to it, and make it needleſs to inſiſt farther on this Argument.</p>
               <p>§. 3. AND now that this diſcourſe may have that Influence upon the Reader which matters of this moment ought to have, let me intreat him to conſider, how much his intereſt and Wiſdome doth oblige him to improve the certainty of Chriſtian Faith into a Chriſtian converſation; that ſoe his knowledge may not aggravate his future doom, and render all his wilful Diſobedience againſt the Chriſtian pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts inexcuſable. The ſpeculative Atheiſt may have ſome colour of a plea, that his miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages were the Reſult of ignorance, not of contempt and wilful diſobedience, whereas the man who owns the certainty of Chriſtian Faith, but lives a contradiction to his knowledge, and by his practiſe gives the lye to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, he, I ſay, can have no ſhadow of
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:105209:226"/>Excuſe. He muſt confeſs his full acquaintance with his Maſters pleaſure, and that his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon did commend thoſe precepts to him, which Chriſtianity enjoyned, as things moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and certain, and infinitely to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before thoſe vile affections which ſtood in competition with them, and thoſe enjoyments he preferr'd before them. His conſcience muſt accuſe him dayly of moſt ſtrange ingratitude, in acting his rebellions againſt the Majeſty of heaven, and his deareſt Lord: it muſt convince him of his ſtupidity and folly, not only in neglecting of ſo great ſalvation, but in running headlong to his owne deſtruction, and being at ſuch coſt and pains to purchaſe to himſelfe damnation. He muſt acknowledge at the dreadfull day, his life was ſpent in a contempt and full defyance of the holy Jeſus; and that he ſtill maintained that contempt in oppoſition to, and in deſpight of the convictions of his conſcience, the ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Holy Spirit, and all the motives of his preſent and eternal intereſt: and then how miſerable muſt is condition be? how dreadful, but how juſt his doom? The ſoreſt judgments that ever happened to the Gentile world, thoſe derelictions which betray'd them to the moſt brutiſh and unnatural luſts, were the reſult of ſin committed againſt conſcience,

                  </note> and if to ſin againſt the dim and gloomy light of Nature became ſo fatal to the Gentile, how diſmal will the doom of Chriſtians be, who ſin againſt the clear Meridian ſhine of Goſpel Revelation? For if Chriſtianity be true, the diſobedient and unbelieving perſon will be convinced by ſad experience of the aſſured falſhood of his infidelity, his flattering hopes, and falſe imaginations, and be depriv'd for ever of Gods blisfull preſence, and thoſe comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble relations which he beares unto his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and all thoſe glories, pleaſures, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which the Saints hereafter ſhall enjoy.
